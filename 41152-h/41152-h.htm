<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>The French were invariably defeated
by the British on this continent
because the latter overcame natural
obstacles which the former blindly trusted
as insurmountable. The French made a
league with the Alleghenies&mdash;and Washington
and Braddock and Forbes conquered
the Alleghenies; the French, later, blindly
trusted the crags at Louisbourg and Quebec&mdash;and
the dauntless Wolfe, in both
instances, accomplished the seemingly
impossible.</p>

<p>The building of Braddock&rsquo;s Road in 1755
across the Alleghenies was the first significant
token in the West of the British grit
which finally overcame. Few roads ever
cost so much, ever amounted to so little at
first, and then finally played so important
a part in the development of any continent.</p>

<h3>ROUTES OF THE FRENCH AND ENGLISH
WESTWARD</h3>


<p>If Providence had reversed the decree
which allowed Frenchmen to settle the
St. Lawrence and Englishmen the
middle Atlantic seaboard, and, instead, had
brought Englishmen to Quebec and Frenchmen
to Jamestown, it is sure that the
English conquest of the American continent
would not have cost the time and
blood it did.</p>

<p>The Appalachian mountain system proved
a tremendous handicap to Saxon conquest.
True, there were waterways inland, the
Connecticut, Hudson, Delaware, James,
and Potomac rivers, but these led straight
into the mountains where for generations
the feeble settlements could not spread and
where explorers became disheartened ere
the rich empire beyond was ever reached.</p>

<p>The St. Lawrence, on the other hand,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
offered a rough but sure course tempting
ambitious men onward to the great lake
system from which it flowed, and the Ottawa
River offered yet another course to the
same splendid goal. So, while the stolid
English were planting sure feet along the
seaboard, New France was spreading by
leaps and bounds across the longitudes. But,
wide-spread as these discoveries were, they
were discoveries only&mdash;the feet of those
who should occupy and defend the land
discovered were heavy where the light
paddle of the voyageur had glistened
brightly beneath the noon-day sun. It was
one thing to seek out such an empire and
quite another thing to occupy and fortify it.
The French reached the Mississippi at the
beginning of the last quarter of the seventeenth
century; ten years after the middle
of the eighteenth they lost all the territory
between the Atlantic and Mississippi&mdash;though
during the last ten years of their
possession they had attempted heroically
to take the nine stitches where a generation
before the proverbial one stitch would
have been of twenty-fold more advantage.
The transportation of arms and stores up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>stream
into the interior, around the foaming
rapids and thundering falls that impeded
the way, was painfully arduous labor, and
the inspiration of the swift explorers,
flushed with fevered dreams, was lacking
to the heavy trains which toiled so far in
the rear.</p>

<p>There were three points at which the
two nations, France and England, met and
struck fire in the interior of North America,
and in each instance it was the French who
were the aggressors&mdash;because of the easy
means of access which they had into the
disputed frontier region. They came up
the Chaudi&egrave;re and down the Kennebec or
up the Richelieu and Lake Champlain,
striking at the heart of New England; they
ascended the St. Lawrence and entered
Lake Ontario, coveted and claimed by the
Province of New York; they pushed
through Lake Ontario and down the Allegheny
to the Ohio River, which Virginia
loved and sought to guard. The French
tried to guard these three avenues of
approach by erecting fortresses on the
Richelieu River, on Lakes Champlain,
Ontario, and Erie, and on the Allegheny<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
and Ohio Rivers. These forts were the
weights on the net which the French were
stretching from the mouth of the St. Lawrence
to the mouth of the Mississippi.
And when that net was drawn taut New
England and New York and Virginia would
be swept into the sea!</p>

<p>It was a splendid scheme&mdash;but the
weights were not heavy enough. After
interminable blunders and delays the
English broke into the net and then by
desperate floundering tore it to fragments.
They reached the line of forts by three
routes, each difficult and hazardous, for in
any case vast stretches of forests were to be
passed; and until the very last, the French
had strong Indian allies who guarded these
forests with valor worthy of a happier
cause. New England defended herself by
ascending the Hudson and crossing the
portage to Lake George and Lake Champlain.
New York ascended the Mohawk
and, crossing the famous Oneida portage to
Odeida Lake, descended the Onondaga
River to Oswego on Lake Ontario. Virginia
spreading out, according to her unchallenged
claims, across the entire continent,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
could only reach the French on the Ohio by
ascending the Potomac to a point near the
mouth of Wills Creek, whence an Indian
path led northwestward over a hundred
miles to the Monongahela, which was
descended to its junction with the Ohio.
The two former routes, to Lake Champlain
and to Lake Ontario, were, with short portages,
practically all-water routes, over
which provisions and army stores could be
transported northward to the zone into
which the French had likewise come by
water-routes. The critical points of both
routes of both hostile nations were the
strategic portages where land travel was
rendered imperative by the difficulties
of navigation. On these portages many
forts instantly sprang into existence&mdash;in
some instances mere posts and entrep&ocirc;ts, in
some cases strongly fortified citadels.</p>

<p>The route from Virginia to the Ohio
Valley, finally made historic by the English
General Braddock, was by far the
most difficult of all the ways by which the
English could meet the French. The Potomac
was navigable for small boats at favorable
seasons for varying distances; but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
beyond the mountains the first water
reached, the Youghiogheny, was useless for
military purposes, as Washington discovered
during the march of the Virginia
Regiment, 1754. The route had, however,
been marked out under the direction of
Captain Thomas Cresap, for the Ohio Company,
and was, at the time of Washington&rsquo;s
expedition, the most accessible passageway
from Virginia to the &ldquo;Forks of the
Ohio.&rdquo; The only other Virginian thoroughfare
westward brought the traveller
around into the valley of the Great Kanawha
which empties into the Ohio two
hundred odd miles below the junction of
the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers.
It was over this slight trail by Wills Creek,
Great Meadows, and the Forks of the Ohio
that Washington had gone in 1753 to the
French forts on French Creek; and it was
this path that the same undaunted youth
widened, the year after, in order to haul
his swivels westward with the vanguard of
Colonel Fry&rsquo;s army which was to drive
the French from the Ohio. Washington&rsquo;s
Road&mdash;as Nemacolin&rsquo;s Path should, in all
conscience, be known&mdash;was widened to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
summit of Mount Braddock. From Mount
Braddock Washington&rsquo;s little force retraced
their steps over the road they had built in
the face of the larger French army sent
against them until they were driven to bay
in their little fortified camp, Fort Necessity,
in Great Meadows, where the capitulation
took place after an all-day&rsquo;s battle.
Marching out with the honors of war, the
remnant of this first English army crawled
painfully back to Wills Creek. All this
took place in the summer of 1754.</p>

<p>The inglorious campaign ending thus in
dismay was of considerably more moment
than its dejected survivors could possibly
have imagined. Small as were the numbers
of contestants on both sides, and distant
though the scene of conflict might have
been, the peace between England and
France was at this moment poised too delicately
not to be disturbed by even the
faintest roll of musketry in the distant
unknown Alleghenies.</p>

<p>Washington had been able neither to
fight successfully nor to avoid a battle by
conducting a decent retreat because the
reinforcements expected from Virginia<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
were not sent him. These &ldquo;reinforcements&rdquo;
were Rutherford&rsquo;s and Clarke&rsquo;s
Independent Companies of Foot which
Governor Dinwiddie had ordered from New
York to Virginia but which did not arrive
in Hampton Roads until the eighth of
June. On the first of September these
troops were marched to Wills Creek, where,
being joined by Captain Demerie&rsquo;s Independent
Company from South Carolina,
they began, on the twelfth of September,
the erection of a fort. The building of this
fort by Virginia nearly a hundred miles west
of Winchester (then a frontier post) is only
paralleled by the energy of Massachusetts in
building two forts in the same year on the
Kennebec River&mdash;Fort Western and Fort
Halifax. New York had almost forgotten
her frontier forts at Saratoga and Oswego,
and the important portage between the
Hudson and Lake George was undefended
while the French were building both Fort
Ticonderoga and Fort Frederick (Crown
Point) on Lake Champlain. New York and
New England could have seized and fortified
Lake Champlain prior to French
encroachment as easily as Virginia could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
fortify Wills Creek. Virginia, however,
had been assisted from the royal chest,
while the assemblies of the other colonies
were in the customary state of turmoil,
governor against legislature. The intermediate
province of Pennsylvania, home of
the peaceful Quakers, looked askance upon
the darkening war-clouds and had done
little or nothing for the protection of her
populous frontiers. As a result, therefore,
the Virginian route to the French, though
longest and most difficult, was made, by the
erection of Fort Cumberland at Wills
Creek, at once the most conspicuous.</p>

<p>Fort Cumberland, named in honor of the
Duke of Cumberland, Captain-general of
the English Army, was located on an eminence
between Wills Creek and the Potomac,
two hundred yards from the former
and about four hundred yards from the
latter. Its length was approximately two
hundred yards and its breadth nearly fifty
yards; and &ldquo;is built,&rdquo; writes an eye-witness
in 1755, &ldquo;by logs driven into the
ground, and about 12 feet above it, with
embrasures for 12 guns, and 10 mounted 4
pounders, besides stocks for swivels, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
loop holes for small arms.&rdquo; As the accompanying
map indicates, the fort was built
with a view to the protection of the store-houses
erected at the mouth of Wills Creek
by the Ohio Company. This is another
suggestion of the close connection between
the commercial and military expansion of
Virginia into the Ohio basin. Wherever a
storehouse of the Ohio Company was
erected a fort soon followed&mdash;with the
exception of the strategic position at the
junction of the Allegheny and Monongahela
where English fort building was brought
to a sudden end by the arrival of the
French, who, on English beginnings,
erected Fort Duquesne in 1754. A little
fort at the mouth of Redstone Creek on the
Monongahela had been erected in 1753 but
that, together with the blasted remains of
Fort Necessity, fell into the hands of the
French in the campaign of 1754. Consequently,
at the dawning of the memorable
year 1755, Fort Cumberland was the most
advanced English position in the West.
The French Indian allies saw to it that it
was safe for no Englishman to step even
one pace nearer the Ohio; they skulked
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
continually in the neighboring forests and
committed many depredations almost within
range of the guns of Fort Cumberland.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>THE VIRGINIA CAMPAIGN</h3>


<p>Governor Dinwiddie&rsquo;s zeal had
increased in inverse ratio to the
success of Virginian arms. After
Washington&rsquo;s repulse at Fort Necessity he
redoubled his energies, incited by a letter
received from one of Washington&rsquo;s hostages
at Fort Duquesne. Colonel Innes was appointed
to command the Virginia troops
and superintend the erection of Fort Cumberland,
while Washington was ordered to
fill up his depleted companies by enlistments
and to move out again to Fort Cumberland.
Indeed it was only by objections
urged in the very strongest manner that
the inconsiderate Governor was deterred
from launching another destitute and ill-equipped
expedition into the snow-drifted
Alleghenies.</p>

<p>But there was activity elsewhere than in
Virginia during the winter of 1754-5.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
Contrec&#339;ur, commanding at Fort Duquesne,
sent clear reports of the campaign
of 1754. The French cause was strengthening.
The success of the French had had
a wonderful effect on the indifferent Indians;
hundreds before only half-hearted
came readily under French domination.
All this was of utmost moment to New
France, possibly of more importance than
keeping her chain of forts to Quebec unbroken.
As Joncaire, the drunken commander
on the Allegheny, had told Washington
in 1753, the English could raise two
men in America to their one&mdash;but not
including their Indians.</p>

<p>It is, probably, impossible for us to realize
with what feelings the French anticipated
war with England on the American
continent. The long campaigns in Europe
had cost both nations much and had
brought no return to either. Even Marshal
Saxe&rsquo;s brilliant victories were purchased
at a fabulous price, and, at the end,
Louis had given up all that was gained in
order to pose &ldquo;as a Prince and not as a
merchant.&rdquo; But in America there was a
prize which both of these nations desired<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
and which was worth fighting for&mdash;the
grandest prize ever won in war! Between
the French and English colonies lay this
black forest stretching from Maine through
New York and Pennsylvania and Virginia
to the Gulf of Mexico. It seemed, to the
French, the silliest dream imaginable for
the English to plan to pierce this forest
and conquer New France. To reach any
of the French forts a long passage by half-known
courses through an inhospitable
wilderness was necessary; and the French
knew by a century of experience what a
Herculean task it was to carry troops and
stores over the inland water and land ways
of primeval America. But for the task they
had had much assistance from the Indians
and were favored in many instances by the
currents of these rivers; the English had
almost no Indian allies and in every case
were compelled to ascend their rivers to
reach the French. However, the formation
of the Ohio Company and the lively days
of the summer of 1754 in the Alleghenies
aroused France as nothing else could; here
was one young Virginian officer who had
found his way through the forests, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
there was no telling how many more there
might be like him. And France, tenfold
more disturbed by Washington&rsquo;s campaign
than there was need for, performed wonders
during the winter of 1754-5. The
story of the action at Fort Necessity was
transmitted to London and was represented
by the British ambassadors at Paris as an
open violation of the peace, &ldquo;which did
not meet with the same degree of respect,&rdquo;
writes a caustic historian, &ldquo;as on former
occasions of complaint: the time now nearly
approaching for the French to pull off the
mask of moderation and peace.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> As if
to confirm this suspicion, the French
marine became suddenly active, the Ministry
ordered a powerful armament to be
fitted at Brest; &ldquo;in all these armaments,&rdquo;
wrote the Earl of Holderness&rsquo;s secret agent,
&ldquo;there appeared a plain design to make
settlements and to build forts; besides,
that it was given out, they resolved to augment
the fortifications at Louisburg, and to
build more forts on the Ohio.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>But there was activity now in England,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>too. Governor Sharpe of Maryland, but
lately appointed Commander-in-chief in
America, had only a hint of what was being
planned and was to have even less share in
its accomplishment; in vain his friends
extolled him as honest&mdash;&ldquo;a little less
honesty,&rdquo; declared George II, characteristically,
&ldquo;and a little more ability were
more to be desired at the moment.&rdquo; And
the rule worked on both sides of the Atlantic.
American affairs had long been in
the hands of the Secretary of the Board of
Trade, the Duke of Newcastle, as perfect
an ass as ever held high office. He had
opposed every policy that did not accord
with his own &ldquo;time serving selfishness&rdquo;
with a persistency only matched by his
unparalleled ignorance. Once thrown into
a panic, it is said, at a rumor that a large
French army had been thrown into Cape
Breton, he was asked where the necessary
transports had been secured.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Transports,&rdquo; he shrieked, &ldquo;I tell you
they marched by land!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By land, to the island of Cape Breton?&rdquo;
was the astonished reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, is Cape Breton an island? Are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
you sure of that?&rdquo; and he ran away with
an &ldquo;Egad, I will go directly and tell the
King that Cape Breton is an island!&rdquo; It is
not surprising that a government which
could ever have tolerated such a man in
high office should have neglected, then
abused, and then lost its American colonies.</p>

<p>But Newcastle gave way to an abler man.
The new campaign in North America was
the conception of the Captain-general of
the British Army, the Duke of Cumberland,
hero of Culloden.</p>

<p>On November 14, 1754, King George
opened Parliament with the statement that
&ldquo;His principal view should be to strengthen
the foundation, and secure the duration
of a general peace; to improve the present
advantages of it for promoting the trade of
his good subjects, and protecting those
possessions which constitute one great
source of their wealth and commerce.&rdquo;
Only in this vague way did His Majesty
refer to the situation in America, lest he
precipitate a debate; but Parliament took
the cue and voted over four million pounds&mdash;one
million of which was to be devoted
to augmenting England&rsquo;s forces &ldquo;by land<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
and sea.&rdquo; Cumberland&rsquo;s plan for the operations
against the French in America had,
sometime before, been forwarded to the
point of selecting a Generalissimo to be
sent to that continent. Major-General
Edward Braddock was appointed to the
service, upon the Duke of Cumberland&rsquo;s
recommendation, on September 24.</p>

<p>Edward Braddock was a lieutenant-colonel
of the line and a major of the Foot
Guards, the choicest corps of the British
army&mdash;a position which cost the holder no
less than eighteen thousand dollars. He
was born in Ireland but was not Irish, for
neither Scot, Irish, nor Papist could aspire
to the meanest rank of the Foot Guards.
He was as old as his century. His promotion
in the army had been jointly due to
the good name of his father, Edward Braddock
I, who was retired as Major-general
in 1715, to his passion for strict discipline,
and to the favor of His Grace the Duke of
Cumberland. Braddock&rsquo;s personal bravery
was proverbial; it was said that his troops
never faced a danger when their commander
was not &ldquo;greedy to lead.&rdquo; In
private life he was dissolute; in disposition,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
&ldquo;a very Iroquois,&rdquo; according to Walpole.
Yet certain of his friends denied the brutality
which many attributed to him. &ldquo;As
we were walking in the Park,&rdquo; one of
Braddock&rsquo;s admirers has recorded, &ldquo;we
heard a poor fellow was to be chastized;
when I requested the General to beg off the
offender. Upon his application to the general
officer, whose name was Dury, he asked
Braddock, How long since he had divested
himself of brutality and the insolence of
his manner? To which the other replied,
&lsquo;You never knew me insolent to my inferiors.
It is only to such rude men as yourself
that I behave with the spirit which I
think they deserve.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> And yet, when
his sister Fanny hanged herself with a
silver girdle to her chamber door, after
losing her fortune at the gaming tables,
the brute of a brother observed, &ldquo;I always
thought she would play till she would be
forced to tuck herself up.&rdquo; On the other
hand it need not be forgotten that Braddock
was for forty-three years in the service of
the famed Coldstream Guards; that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
probably conducted himself with courage
in the Vigo expedition and in the Low
Countries, and was a survivor of bloody
Dettingen, Culloden, Fontenoy, and Bergen-op-Zoom.
In 1753 he was stationed
at Gibraltar where, &ldquo;with all his brutality,&rdquo;
writes Walpole, &ldquo;he made himself
adored, and where scarce any governor
was endured before.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Two months and one day after Braddock&rsquo;s
commission was signed he received
two letters of instructions, one from the
King and one from the Duke of Cumberland.
&ldquo;For your better direction in discharge
of y<sup>e</sup> Trust thereby reposed in
You,&rdquo; reads the King&rsquo;s letter, &ldquo;We have
judged it proper to give You the following
Instructions.&rdquo; The document is divided
into thirteen heads:</p>

<p>1. Two regiments of Foot commanded
by Sir Peter Halket and Colonel Dunbar,
with a train of artillery and necessary ships
were ordered to &ldquo;repair to North America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>2. Braddock ordered to proceed to
America and take under his command these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
troops, cultivating meanwhile &ldquo;a good
understanding &amp; correspondence with
Aug. Keppel Esq<sup>r</sup>.&rdquo; who was appointed
commander of the American squadron.</p>

<p>3. Orders him also to take command of
and properly distribute 3000 men which
the Governors of the provinces had been
ordered to raise to serve under Governor
Shirley and Sir William Pepperell; informs
him that Sir John St. Clair, deputy Quarter
Master General, and Jas. Pitcher Esq<sup>r</sup>.,
&ldquo;our commissary of y<sup>e</sup> musters, in North
America,&rdquo; had been sent to prepare for the
arrival of the troops from Ireland and for
raising the troops in America. Upon Braddock&rsquo;s
arrival he should inform himself of
the progress of these preparations.</p>

<p>4. Provisions for the troops from Ireland
had been prepared lest, upon arrival in
America, they should be in want.</p>

<p>5. &ldquo;Whereas, We have given Orders
to our said Gov<sup>rs</sup> to provide carefully a sufficient
Quantity of fresh victuals for y<sup>e</sup> use
of our Troops at their arrival, &amp; y<sup>t</sup> they
should also furnish all our officers who may
have occasion to go from Place to Place,
with all necessaries for travelling by Land,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
in case there are no means of going by
Sea; &amp; likewise, to observe and obey all
such orders as shall be given by You or Persons
appointed by you from time to time
for quartering Troops, impressing Carriages,
&amp; providing all necessaries for such
Forces as shall arrive or be raised in America,
and y<sup>t</sup> the s<sup>d</sup> several Services shall be
performed at the charge of y<sup>e</sup> respective
Governments, wherein the same shall happen.
It is our Will &amp; Pleasure y<sup>t</sup> you
should, pursuant thereto, apply to our s<sup>d</sup>
Governors, or any of them, upon all such
Exigencies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>6. The Governors had been directed
&ldquo;to endeavor to prevail upon y<sup>e</sup> Assemblies
of their respective Provinces to raise forthwith
as large a sum as can be afforded as
their contribution to a common Fund, to
be employed provisionally for y<sup>e</sup> general
Service in North America.&rdquo; Braddock
was urged to assist in this and have great
care as to its expenditure.</p>

<p>7. Concerns Braddock&rsquo;s relations with
the colonial governors; especially directing
that a Council of War which shall include
them be formed to determine, by majority<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
vote, matters upon which no course has
been defined.</p>

<p>8. &ldquo;You will not only cultivate y<sup>e</sup> best
Harmony &amp; Friendship possible with y<sup>e</sup>
several Governors of our Colonies &amp; Provinces,
but likewise with y<sup>e</sup> Chiefs of y<sup>e</sup> Indian
Tribes ... to endeavor to engage
them to take part &amp; act with our Forces, in
such operations as you shall think most
expedient.&rdquo;</p>

<p>9. Concerns securing the alliance and
interest of the Indians and giving them
presents.</p>

<p>10. Orders Braddock to prevent any
commerce between the French and the
English provinces.</p>

<p>11. Concerning the relative precedency
of royal and colonial commissions.</p>

<p>12. Describes the copies of documents
enclosed to Braddock concerning previous
relations with the colonies for defense
against French encroachment; &ldquo;... And
as Extracts of Lieut Gov<sup>r</sup> Dinwiddie&rsquo;s
Letters of May 10<sup>th</sup>, June 18<sup>th</sup>, &amp; July 24<sup>th</sup>,
relating to the Summons of the Fort which
was erecting on y<sup>e</sup> Forks of y<sup>e</sup> Monongahela,
and y<sup>e</sup> Skirmish y<sup>t</sup> followed soon after, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>&amp;
likewise of y<sup>e</sup> action in the Great Meadows,
near the River Ohio, are herewith delivered
to you, you will be fully acquainted with
what has hitherto happened of a hostile
Nature upon the Banks of that River.&rdquo;</p>

<p>13. Concerns future correspondence
between Braddock and the Secretaries of
State to whom his reports were to be sent.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The communication from the Duke of
Cumberland written by his Aide, Colonel
Napier, throws much light upon the verbal
directions which Braddock received before
he sailed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;His Royal Highness the Duke, in the
several audiences he has given you, entered
into a particular explanation of every part
of the service you are about to be employed
in; and as a better rule for the execution
of His Majesty&rsquo;s instructions, he last Saturday
communicated to you his own sentiments
of this affair, and since you were
desirous of forgetting no part thereof, he
has ordered me to deliver them to you in
writing. His Royal Highness has this
service very much at heart, as it is of the
highest importance to his majesty&rsquo;s Ameri<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>can
dominions, and to the honour of his
troops employed in those parts. His Royal
Highness likewise takes a particular interest
in it, as it concerns you, whom he
recommended to his majesty to be nominated
to the chief command.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His Royal Highness&rsquo;s opinion is, that
immediately after your landing, you consider
what artillery and other implements
of war it will be necessary to transport to
Will&rsquo;s Creek for your first operation on the
Ohio, that it may not fail you in the service;
and that you form a second field train,
with good officers and soldiers, which shall
be sent to Albany and be ready to march
for the second operation at Niagara. You
are to take under your command as many
as you think necessary of the two companies
of artillery that are in Nova Scotia and
Newfoundland as soon as the season will
allow, taking care to leave enough to defend
the Island. Captain Ord, a very experienced
officer, of whom his Royal Highness
has a great opinion, will join you as soon
as possible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As soon as Shirley&rsquo;s and Pepperel&rsquo;s
regiments are near complete, his Royal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
Highness is of opinion you should cause
them to encamp, not only that they may
sooner be disciplined, but also to draw the
attention of the French and keep them in
suspense about the place you really design
to attack. His Royal Highness does not
doubt that the officers and captains of the
several companies will answer his expectation
in forming and disciplining their
respective troops. The most strict discipline
is always necessary, but more particularly
so in the service you are engaged in.
Wherefore his Royal Highness recommends
to you that it be constantly observed among
the troops under your command, and to be
particularly careful that they be not thrown
into a panic by the Indians, with whom
they are yet unacquainted, whom the
French will certainly employ to frighten
them. His Royal Highness recommends
to you the visiting your posts night and
day; that your Colonels and other officers
be careful to do it; and that you yourself
frequently set them the example; and give
all your troops plainly to understand that
no excuse will be admitted for any surprise
whatsoever.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a></span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Should the Ohio expedition continue
any considerable time, and Pepperell&rsquo;s and
Shirley&rsquo;s regiments be found sufficient to
undertake in the mean while the reduction
of Niagara, his Royal Highness would
have you consider whether you could go
there in person, leaving the command of
the troops on the Ohio to some officer on
whom you might depend, unless you shall
think it better for the service to send to
those troops some person whom you had
designed to command on the Ohio; but this
is a nice affair, and claims your particular
attention. Colonel Shirley is the next
commander after you, wherefore if you
should send such an officer he must conduct
himself so as to appear only in quality
of a friend or counsellor in the presence of
Colonel Shirley: and his Royal Highness is
of opinion that the officer must not produce
or make mention of the commission you
give him to command except in a case of
absolute necessity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ordering of these matters may be
depended on, if the expedition at Crown
Point can take place at the same time that
Niagara is besieged.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;If after the Ohio expedition is ended it
should be necessary for you to go with your
whole force to Niagara it is the opinion of
his Royal Highness that you should carefully
endeavour to find a shorter way from
the Ohio thither than that of the Lake;
which however you are not to attempt
under any pretense whatever without a
moral certainty of being supplied with provisions,
&amp;c. As to your design of making
yourself master of Niagara, which is of the
greatest consequence, his Royal Highness
recommends to you to leave nothing to
chance in the prosecution of that enterprize.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With regard to the reducing of Crown
Point, the provincial troops being best
acquainted with the country, will be of the
most service.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After the taking of this fort his Royal
Highness advises you to consult with the
Governors of the neighboring provinces,
where it will be most proper to build a fort
to cover the frontiers of those provinces.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As to the forts which you think ought
to be built (and of which they are perhaps
too fond in that country), his Royal Highness
recommends the building of them in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
such a manner, that they may not require a
strong garrison. He is of opinion that you
ought not to build considerable forts, cased
with stone, till the plans and estimates
thereof have been sent to England and approved
of by the Government here. His
Royal Highness thinks that stockaded forts,
with pallisadoes and a good ditch, capable
of containing 200 men or 400 upon an emergency,
will be sufficient for the present.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As Lieutenant Colonel Lawrence, who
commands at Nova Scotia, hath long protracted
the taking of Beau-Sejour, his Royal
Highness advises you to consult with him,
both with regard to the time and the manner
of executing that design. In this enterprise
his Royal Highness foresees that his
majesty&rsquo;s ships may be of great service, as
well by transporting the troops and warlike
implements, as intercepting the stores and
succors that might be sent to the French
either by the Baye Fran&ccedil;oise, or from Cape
Breton by the Baye Verte on the other side
of the Isthmus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With regard to your winter quarters
after the operations of the campaign are
finished, his Royal Highness recommends it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
to you to examine whether the French will
not endeavor to make some attempts next
season and in what parts they will most
probably make them. In this case it will
be most proper to canton your troops on
that side, at such distances, that they may
easily be assembled for the common
defence. But you will be determined in
this matter by appearances, and the intelligence,
which it hath been recommended
to you to procure by every method immediately
after your landing. It is unnecessary
to put you in mind how careful you
must be to prevent being surprised. His
Royal Highness imagines that your greatest
difficulty will be the subsisting of your
troops. He therefore recommends it to
you to give your chief attention to this
matter, and to take proper measures relative
thereto with the Governors and with your
quartermasters and commissaries.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope that the extraordinary supply
put on board the fleet, and the 1000 barrels
of beef destined for your use, will facilitate
and secure the supplying of your troops
with provisions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I have omitted nothing of all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
the points wherein you desired to be informed:
if there should be any intricate
point unthought of, I desire you would
represent it to me now, or at any other
time; and I shall readily take it upon me
to acquaint his Royal Highness thereof,
and shall let you know his opinion on the
subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you much success with all my
heart; and as this success will infinitely
rejoice all your friends, I desire you would
be fully persuaded that no body will take
greater pleasure in acquainting them thereof,
than him, who is, &amp;c.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If excuse is needed for offering in such
detail these orders, it is that few men
have ever suffered more heavily in reputation
and in person because of the failures,
misconceptions, and shortcomings of others
than the man who received these orders
and attempted to act upon them.</p>

<p>These instructions and the letter from
the Duke of Cumberland make two things
very clear: it is clear from the King&rsquo;s
instructions (item 12) that the campaign to
the Ohio Valley from Virginia was to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
the important <i>coup</i> of the summer; the
documents mentioned were to acquaint
Braddock &ldquo;with what has hitherto happened
of a hostile Nature upon the Banks
of that River.&rdquo; This is made more certain
by one of the first sentences in the Duke of
Cumberland&rsquo;s letter, &ldquo;that immediately
after your landing, you consider what
artillery and other implements of war it will
be necessary to transport to Will&rsquo;s Creek for
your first operation on the Ohio.&rdquo; It is also
clear that Braddock was helplessly dependent
upon the success with which the
American governors carried out the royal
orders previously sent to them. They had
been ordered to raise money and troops,
provide provisions, open the necessary
roads, supply carriages and horses, and
conciliate and arm the Indian nations on
the frontier. How far they were successful
it will be proper to study later; for the
moment, let us consider the destination of
the little army that set sail, after innumerable
delays, from the Downs December
21, 1754, led by the famed &ldquo;Centurian&rdquo;
whose figure-head adorns Greenwich Hospital
today.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>Sending Braddock and his army to Virginia
against the French on the Ohio was a
natural blunder of immeasurable proportions.
It was natural, because all eyes had
been turned to Virginia by the activity of
the Ohio Company, Washington&rsquo;s campaign
of the preceding year, and the erection of
Fort Cumberland on the farthest frontier.
These operations gave a seeming importance
to the Virginia route westward which
was all out of harmony with its length and
the facilities offered. &ldquo;Before we parted,&rdquo;
a friend of Braddock wrote concerning the
General&rsquo;s last night in London, &ldquo;the General
told me that he should never see me
more; for he was going with a handful of
men to conquer whole nations; and to do this
they must cut their way through unknown
woods. He produced a map of the country,
saying, at the same time, &lsquo;Dear Pop,
we are sent like sacrifices to the altar.&rsquo;&rdquo;
This gloomy prophecy was fulfilled with
a fatal accuracy for which the choice
of the Virginia route was largely responsible.
Braddock&rsquo;s campaign had been fully
considered in all its bearings in the royal
councils, and the campaign through Virgi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>nia
to Fort Duquesne seems to have been
definitely decided upon. Even before Braddock
had crossed half of the Atlantic his
Quartermaster-General, St. Clair, had
passed all the way through Virginia and
Maryland to Fort Cumberland in carrying
out orders issued to him before Braddock
had reached England from Gibraltar.
&ldquo;Having procured from the Governors of
Pennsylvania and Virginia and from other
sources,&rdquo; writes Mr. Sargent, &ldquo;all the
maps and information that were obtainable
respecting the country through which the
expedition was to pass, he [St. Clair] proceeded
in company with Governor Sharpe
of Maryland upon a tour of inspection to
Will&rsquo;s Creek.&rdquo; He inspected the Great
Falls of the Potomac and laid plans for
their being made passable for boats in which
the army stores were to be shipped to Fort
Cumberland, and had made contracts for
the construction of the boats. He laid out
a camp at Watkin&rsquo;s Ferry. It is doubtful
whether Braddock had ever had one word
to say in connection with all these plans
which irrevocably doomed him to the
almost impossible feat of making Fort<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
Cumberland a successful base of supplies
and center of operations against the
French. Moreover the Virginia route,
being not only one of the longest on which
Braddock could have approached the
French, was the least supplied with any
manner of wagons. &ldquo;For such is the
attention,&rdquo; wrote Entick, &ldquo;of the Virginians
towards their staple trade of tobacco,
that they scarce raise as much corn, as is
necessary for their own subsistence; and
their country being well provided with
water-carriage in great rivers an army which
requires a large supply of wheel-carriages
and beasts of burden, could not expect to
be furnished with them in a place where
they are not in general use.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> &ldquo;Their
Produce is Tobacco,&rdquo; wrote one of Braddock&rsquo;s
army, of the Virginians, &ldquo;they are
so attached to that, and their Avarice to
raise it, makes them neglect every Comfort
of Life.&rdquo; As has often been said, Carlisle
in Pennsylvania would have made a far
better center of operations than Fort Cumberland,
and eventually it proved to be
Pennsylvania wagons in which the stores<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
of the army were transported&mdash;without
which the army could not have moved
westward from Fort Cumberland one single
mile. &ldquo;Mr. Braddock had neither provisions
nor carriage for a march of so considerable
a length, which was greatly increased
and embarrassed by his orders to take the
rout of Will&rsquo;s Creek; which road, as it
was the worst provided with provisions,
more troublesome and hazardous, and much
more about, than by way of Pennsylvania.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Not to use superlatives, it would seem
that the American colonial governors and
St. Clair might have presented to Braddock
the difficulties of the Virginia route as compared
with the Pennsylvania route early
enough to have induced the latter to make
Carlisle his base for the Ohio campaign;
but there is no telling now where the blunder
was first made; a writer in <i>Gentleman&rsquo;s
Magazine</i> affirmed that the expedition was
&ldquo;sent to <i>Virginia</i> instead of <i>Pennsylvania</i>,
to their insuperable disadvantage, merely
to answer the lucerative views of a friend
of the ministry, to whose share the remit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>tances
would then fall at the rate of 2&frac12; <i>per
cent</i> profit.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Even the suspicion of such treachery as
sending Braddock to Virginia to indulge
the purse of a favorite is the more revolting
because of the suggestion in the letter
from the Duke of Cumberland that Braddock,
personally, favored an attack on Fort
Niagara&mdash;which, it has been universally
agreed, was the thing he should have done.
&ldquo;As to <i>your design</i> of making yourself
master of Niagara&rdquo;&mdash;the italics are mine&mdash;wrote
Cumberland; and, though he refers
at the beginning to their numerous interviews,
this is the sole mention throughout
the letter of any opinion or plan of Braddock&rsquo;s.
&ldquo;Had General <i>Braddock</i> made it
his first business to secure the command of
lake Ontario, which he might easily have
done soon enough to have stopt the <i>force</i>
that was sent from <i>Canada</i> to <i>Du Quesne</i>,
that fort must have been surrendered to
him upon demand; and had he gone this
way to it, greater part of that vast sum<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
might have been saved to the nation, which
was expended in making a waggon road,
through the woods and mountains, the way
he went.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Yet Cumberland&rsquo;s orders were
distinct to go to Niagara by way of Virginia
and Fort Duquesne.</p>

<p>Horace Walpole&rsquo;s characterization of
Braddock is particularly graphic and undoubtedly
just&mdash;&ldquo;desperate in his fortune,
brutal in his behavior, obstinate in his
sentiments, intrepid and capable.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> The
troops given him for the American expedition
were well suited to bring out every
defect in his character; these were the
fragments of the 44th and 48th regiments,
then stationed in Ireland. Being deficient
(even in time of peace), both had to be recruited
up to five hundred men each. The
campaign was unpopular and the recruits
secured were of the worst type&mdash;&ldquo;who,
had they not been in the army, would
probably have been in Bridewell [prison].&rdquo;
Walpole wrote, &ldquo;the troops allotted to him
most ill-chosen, being draughts of the most
worthless in some Irish regiments, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
anew disgusted by this species of banishment.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
&ldquo;The mutinous Spirit of the
Men encreases,&rdquo; wrote an officer of Braddock&rsquo;s
army during the march to Fort
Duquesne, &ldquo;but we will get the better of
that, we will see which will be tired first,
they of deserving Punishments, or we of
inflicting them ... they are mutinous,
and this came from a higher Spring than
the Hardships here, for they were tainted
in <i>Ireland</i> by the factious Cry against
the L&mdash; L&mdash; Ld G&mdash;, and the Primate;
the wicked Spirit instilled there by Pamphlets
and Conversation, got amongst the
common Soldiers, who, tho&rsquo; they are <i>Englishmen</i>,
yet are not the less stubborn and
mutinous for that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus the half-mutinous army, and its
&ldquo;brutal,&rdquo; &ldquo;obstinate,&rdquo; &ldquo;intrepid,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;capable&rdquo; commander fared on across the
sea to Virginia during the first three months
of the memorable year of 1755. By the
middle of March the entire fleet had
weighed anchor in the port of Alexandria,
Virginia.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>
<p>The situation could not be described
better than Entick has done in the following
words: &ldquo;Put all these together, what
was extraordinary in his [Braddock&rsquo;s] conduct,
and what was extraordinary in the
way of the Service, there could be formed
no good idea of the issue of such an untoward
expedition.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>FROM ALEXANDRIA TO FORT CUMBERLAND</h3>


<p>What it was that proved to be &ldquo;extraordinary
in the way of the
Service&rdquo; General Braddock soon
discovered, and it is a fair question whether,
despite all that has been written concerning
his unfitness for his position, another man
with one iota less &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; than Braddock
could have done half that Braddock did.</p>

<p>The Colonies were still quite asleep to
their danger; the year before, Governor
Dinwiddie had been at his wits&rsquo; end to raise
in Virginia a few score men for Fry and
Washington, and had at last succeeded
by dint of drafts and offers of bounty in
western lands. Pennsylvania was hopelessly
embroiled in the then unconstitutional
question of equal taxation of proprietary
estates. The New York assembly
was, and not without reason, clannish in
giving men and money for use only within<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
her own borders. It is interesting to notice
the early flashes of lurking revolutionary
fire in the Colonies when the mother-country
attempted to wield them to serve
her own politic schemes. Braddock was
perhaps one of the first Englishmen to suggest
the taxation of America and, within a
year, Walpole wrote concerning instructions
sent to a New York Governor, that
they &ldquo;seemed better calculated for the
latitude of Mexico and for a Spanish tribunal
than for a free rich British Settlement,
and in such opulence and of such haughtiness,
that suspicion had long been conceived
of their meditating to throw off their
dependence on their mother country.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
It would have been well for the provinces
if they had postponed for a moment their
struggle against English methods, and
planned as earnestly for the success of English
arms as they did when defeat opened the
floodgates of murder and pillage all along
their wide frontiers. But it is not possible
to more than mention here the struggles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
between the short-sighted assemblies and
the short-sighted royal governors. The
practical result, so far as Braddock was
concerned, was the ignoring, for the greater
part, of all the instructions sent from London.
This meant that Braddock was abandoned
to the fate of carrying out orders
wretchedly planned under the most trying
circumstances conceivable. Instead of
having everything prepared for him, he
found almost nothing prepared, and on
what had been done he found he could
place no dependence. Little wonder the
doomed man has been remembered as a
&ldquo;brute&rdquo; in America! To have shouldered
the blame for the lethargy of the Colonies,
for the jealousy of their governors, and for
the wretchedness of the orders given Braddock,
would have made any man brutish in
word and action. Pennsylvanians have
often accused Washington of speaking like
a &ldquo;brute&rdquo; when, no doubt in anger, he
exclaimed that the officials of that Province
should have been flogged for their indifference;
they were, God knows,&mdash;but by the
Indians after Braddock&rsquo;s defeat.</p>

<p>The desperateness of Braddock&rsquo;s situa<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>tion
became very plain by the middle of
April, when the Governors of the Colonies
met at his request at the camp at Alexandria
to determine upon the season&rsquo;s campaigns.
But it was not until later that he
knew the full depths of his unfortunate
situation. As early as March 18 Braddock
wrote Sir Thomas Robinson a most
discouraging letter, but on April 19,
after the Governors&rsquo; Council, another
letter to Robinson shows the exact situation.
As to the fund which the Colonies
had been ordered to raise, the Governors
&ldquo;gave it as their unanimous opinion that
such a Fund can never be establish&rsquo;d in the
Colonies without the Aid of Parliament.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
They were therefore &ldquo;unanimously of the
Opinion that the Kings Service in the
Colonies, and the carrying on of the present
Expedition must be at a stand, unless the
General shall think proper to make use of
his Credit upon the Government at home to
defray the Expense of all the Operations
under his Direction.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> In Braddock&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>letter of April 19 he affirms &ldquo;The &pound;20,000
voted in Virginia has been expended tho
not yet collected; Pennsylvania and Maryland
still refuse to contribute anything;
New York has raised &pound;5,000 Currency for
the use of the Troops whilst in that province,
which I have directed to be applied
for the particular Service of the Garrison
at Oswego.... I shall march from this
place for Frederick tomorrow Morning
in my Way to Will&rsquo;s Creek, where I should
have been before this time, had I not been
prevented by waiting for the artillery, from
which I still fear further delays, I hope
to be upon the mountains early in May and
some time in June to have it in my power
to dispatch an Express with some Account
of the Event of our operations upon the
Ohio.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The disappointed man was not
very sanguine of success, but adds, &ldquo;I
hope, Sir, there is good prospect of success
in every part of the plan I have laid before
you, but it is certain every single attempt
is more likely to succeed from the Extensiveness
of it.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> By this he meant that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
the French, attacked at several points at
once, would not be able to send reinforcements
from one point to another.</p>

<p>But more serious disappointments awaited
Braddock&mdash;a great part of the definite
promises made by Governor Dinwiddie
were never to be realized. The governor
and Sir John St. Clair had promised Braddock
that twenty-five hundred horses and
two hundred wagons would be in readiness
at Fort Cumberland to transport the army
stores across the mountains, and that a large
quantity of beeves and other provisions
would be awaiting the army through July
and August. Braddock was also promised
the support of a large force of Indians and,
conformably to his orders, had been careful
to send the usual presents to the tribes in
question. He soon learned, however, that
the short-sighted Assemblies of both Virginia
and Pennsylvania had already alienated
the Indians whom they should have
attached to their cause, and but a handful
were faithful now when the crisis had
come; for the faithfulness of these few
Braddock was perhaps largely in debt to
Washington, whom they followed during<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
the campaign of the preceding year. As
to the details of his miserable situation,
nothing is of more interest than the frank
letter written by Braddock to Sir John
Robinson from Fort Cumberland, June 5:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had the Honor of writing to you
from Frederick the latter end of April.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the 10th of May I arrived at this
place, and on the 17th the train join&rsquo;d me
from Alexandria after a March of twenty
seven days, having met with many more
Delays and Difficulties than I had even
apprehended, from the Badness of the
Roads, Scarcity of Forage, and a general
Want of Spirit in the people to forward the
Expedition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have at last collected the whole Force
with which I propose to march to the
Attack of Fort Duquesne, amounting to
about two thousand effective Men, eleven
hundred of which Number are Americans
of the southern provinces, whose slothful
and languid Disposition renders them very
unfit for Military Service. I have employ&rsquo;d
the properest officers to form and discipline
them and great pains has and shall be
taken to make them as useful as possible.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;When I first came to this place I
design&rsquo;d to have refresh&rsquo;d the Troops by a
few days Rest, but the Disappointments I
have met with in procuring the Number of
Wagons and Horses necessary for my
March over the Mountains have detained
me near a Month.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Before I left Williamsburg I was
informed by the Deputy Quarter Master
general, who was then at this Fort, that
2500 Horses and 200 Wagons might be
depended upon from Virginia and Maryland,
but as I had the utmost reason to
fear a Disappointment from my daily Experience
of the Falsehood of every person
with whom I was concern&rsquo;d, I therefore
before I left Frederick, desired Mr. Franklin,
postmaster of Pennsylvania, and a Man
of great Influence in that Province, to contract
for 150 Waggons and a Number of
Horses, which he has executed with great
punctuality and Integrity, and is almost
the only Instance of Ability and Honesty I
have known in these provinces; His Waggons
and Horses have all joined me, and
are indeed my whole Dependence, the great
promises of Virginia and Maryland having
produc&rsquo;d only about twenty Waggons and
two hundred Horses: With the Number I
now have I shall be enabled with the utmost
difficulty to move from this place, marching
with one half of the provision I
entended and having been oblig&rsquo;d to
advance a large Detachment in order to
make a Deposite of provisions upon the
Alliganey Mountains about five days March
from me.</p>

</div>

<p>&ldquo;It would be endless, Sir, to particularize
the numberless Instances of the Want
of public and private Faith, and of the most
absolute Disregard of all Truth, which I
have met with in carrying on of His Majesty&rsquo;s
Service on this continent. I cannot
avoid adding one or two Instances to what
I have already given.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A Contract made by the Governor of
Virginia for 1100 Beeves was laid before
me to be delivered in July and August for
the subsistence of the Troops, which Contract
he had entered into upon the Credit
of twenty thousand pounds Currency voted
by the Assembly for the Service of the
Expedition. Depending upon this I regulated
my Convoys accordingly, and a few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
days since the Contractors inform&rsquo;d me that
the Assembly had refus&rsquo;d to fulfill the
Governors Engagements, and the Contract
was consequently void: as it was an Affair
of the greatest Importance, I immediately
offer&rsquo;d to advance the Money requir&rsquo;d by
the Terms of the Contract, but this the
Contractor rejected, unless I would pay
him one third more; and postpone the
Delivery of the Beeves two Months, at
which time they would have been of no use
to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another Instance is the Agent employ&rsquo;d
in the Province of Maryland for
furnishing their Troops with provision,
who delivered it in such Condition that it
is all condemn&rsquo;d upon a Survey, and I have
been obliged to replace it by sending to
the Distance of an hundred Miles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This Behavior in the people does not
only produce infinite Difficulty in carrying
on His Majesty&rsquo;s Service but also greatly
increases the Expense of it, the Charge
thereby occasion&rsquo;d in the Transportation of
provision and Stores through an unsettled
Country (with which even the Inhabitants
of the lower parts are entirely unac<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>quainted)
and over a continued succession
of Mountains, is many times more than
double the original Cost of them; for this
reason I am obliged to leave a Quantity of
provision at Alexandria, which would be of
great Service to use at this place. The
Behaviour of the Governments appears to
me to be without excuse, but it may be
some Extenuation of the Guilt of the lower
Class of people, that upon former occasions
their assistance in publick has been ill
rewarded, and their payments neglected;
the bad Effects of which proceeding we
daily experience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I have His Majesty&rsquo;s Orders to
establish as much as possible a good understanding
with the Indians, I have gathered
some from the Frontier of Pennsylvania
chiefly of the Six Nations, with whom I
have had two or three Conferences, and
have given them proper Presents; the
Number already with me is about fifty, and
I have some hopes of more: Upon my first
Arrivall in America, I received strong
assurances of the assistance of a great
Number of Southern Indians, which I have
entirely lost through the Misconduct of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
Government of Virginia: And indeed the
whole Indian Affairs have been so imprudently
and dishonestly conducted, that it
was with the greatest difficulty I could gain
a proper Confidence with those I have
engag&rsquo;d, and even that could not be
attain&rsquo;d, nor can be preserv&rsquo;d without a
great Expense.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Nature of the Country prevents
all Communication with the French but by
Indians, and their Intelligence is not much
to be depended upon; they all agree the
Number of French now in Fort Duquesne
is very inconsiderable, but that they pretend
to expect large Reinforcements.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have an Account of the arrival of the
two thousand Arms for the New England
Forces, and that they are sailed for Nova
Scotia. Batteaus and Boats are preparing
for the Forces destined to the Attacks of
Niagara and Crown Point, but the province
of New York, which by its situation must
furnish the greater part, do not act with so
much vigor as I could wish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In order to secure a short and easy
Communication with the province of Pensilvania,
after the Forces have pass&rsquo;d the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
Alligany Mountains, I have apply&rsquo;d to
Governor Morris to get a Road cut from
Shippensburg in that Province to the River
Youghyaughani; up which he informs me he
has set a proper Number of Men at work,
and that it will be compleated in a Month:
This I look upon to be an Affair of the
greatest Importance, as well for securing
future Supplies of Provisions, as for obtaining
more speedy Intelligence of what passes
in the Northern Colonies.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;I wait now for the last Convoy and
shall, if I do not meet with further Disappointments,
begin my March over the
Alleghaney Mountains in about five days.
The Difficulties we have to meet with by
the best Accounts are very great; the
Distance from hence to the Forts is an
hundred and ten miles, a Road to be cut
and made the whole way with infinite Toil
and Labor, over rocky Mountains of an
excessive Height and Steepness, and many
Stoney Creeks and Rivers to cross.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Braddock&rsquo;s army under Halket and Dun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>bar
proceeded to Fort Cumberland from
Alexandria by various routes. Governor

<p>One of the few monuments of Braddock&rsquo;s
days stands beside the Potomac, within the
limits of the city of Washington. It is a
gigantic rock, the &ldquo;Key of Keys,&rdquo; now
almost lost to sight and forgotten. It may
still be found, and efforts are on foot to
have it appropriately marked. It is known
in tradition as &ldquo;Braddock&rsquo;s Rock&rdquo;&mdash;on
the supposition that here some of Brad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>dock&rsquo;s
men landed just below the mouth
of Rock Creek en route to Frederick and
Fort Cumberland. It is unimportant
whether the legend is literally true.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> A
writer, disputing the legend, yet affirms
that the public has reason &ldquo;to require that
the destructive hand of man be stayed, and
that the remnants of the ancient and historic
rock should be rescued from oblivion.&rdquo;
The rock may well bear the name of Braddock,
as the legend has it. Nothing could
be more typical of the man&mdash;grim, firm,
unreasoning, unyielding.</p>

<h3>A SEAMAN&rsquo;S JOURNAL</h3>


<p>One of the most interesting documents
relative to Braddock&rsquo;s expedition is
a <i>Journal</i> kept by one of the thirty
seamen sent with Braddock by Commodore
Keppel. The original manuscript was presented
by Colonel Macbean to the Royal
Artillery Library, Woolwich, and is first
published here.</p>

<p>An expanded version of this document
was published in Winthrop Sargent&rsquo;s <i>History
of Braddock&rsquo;s Expedition</i>, entitled &ldquo;The
Morris Journal&rdquo;&mdash;so called because it was
in the possession of the Rev. Francis-Orpen
Morris, Nunburnholme Rectory, Yorkshire,
who had published it in pamphlet
form.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Concerning its authorship Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
Sargent says, &ldquo;I do not know who was the
author of this Journal: possibly he may
have been of the family of Capt. Hewitt.
He was clearly one of the naval officers
detached for this service by Com. Keppel,
whom sickness detained at Fort Cumberland
during the expedition.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>A comparison of the expanded version
with the original here printed shows that
the &ldquo;Morris Journal&rdquo; was written by Engineer
Harry Gordon of the 48th Artillery.
The entry in the expanded version for June
2 reads: &ldquo;Col. Burton, Capt. Orme, Mr
Spendlowe and self went out to reconnoitre
the road.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> In the original, under the
same date, we read: &ldquo;Colonel Burton,
Capt. Orme, Mr Engineer Gordon &amp; Lieut
Spendelow were order&rsquo;d to reconnoitre the
Roads.&rdquo; Why Mr. Gordon desired to suppress
his name is as inexplicable as the failure
of the Rev. Francis-Orpen Morris, who
compared the expanded and the original
manuscripts, to announce it. The proof is
made more sure by the fact that Mr. Gordon
usually refers to himself as an &ldquo;Engineer,&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
as in the entry for June 3: &ldquo;This morning
an Engineer and 100 men began working
on the new road....&rdquo; In the
original the name is given: &ldquo;Engineer
Gordon with 100 Pioneers began to break
Ground on the new Road....&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> He
refers to himself again on July 9 as &ldquo;One
of our Engineers&rdquo;: &ldquo;One of our Engineers,
who was in the front of the Carpenters
marking the road, saw the Enemy first.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
It is well known that Gordon first caught
sight of the enemy and the original journal
affirms this to have been the case: &ldquo;Mr
Engineer Gordon was the first Man that
saw the Enemy.&rdquo; Mr. Sargent said the
author &ldquo;was clearly one of the naval officers
detached ... by Com. Keppel.&rdquo;
Though Mr. Gordon, as author, impersonated
a seaman, there is certainly very much
more light thrown on the daily duties of an
engineer than on those of a sailor; there is
far more matter treating of cutting and
marking Braddock&rsquo;s Road than of handling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
ropes and pulleys. It is also significant
that Gordon, from first to last, was near
the seamen and had all the necessary information
for composing a journal of which one
of them might have been the author. He
was in Dunbar&rsquo;s regiment on the march from
Alexandria&mdash;as were the seamen. He,
with the carpenters, was possibly brigaded
in the Second Brigade, with the seamen,
and in any case he was with the van of the
army on the fatal ninth as were the seamen.</p>

<p>As to the authorship of the original journal
the document gives no hint. From Mr.
Gordon&rsquo;s attempt to cover his own identity
by introducing the word &ldquo;self&rdquo; in the
latter part of the entry of June 3, it might
be supposed the original manuscript was
written by the &ldquo;Midshipman&rdquo; referred to
under that date in the original journal.
But the two midshipmen given as naval
officers in the expedition, Haynes and Talbot,
were killed in the defeat.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>The original journal which follows is of
interest because of the description of the
march of Dunbar&rsquo;s brigade through Maryland
and Virginia to Fort Cumberland.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
The remainder was evidently composed

<p>D<sup>o</sup>. 10<sup>th</sup>: March&rsquo;d to <i>Will&rsquo;s Creek</i>; and

Fort, when the General past the Troops;
Colonel Dunbar informed them, that there
were a number of Indians at <i>Will&rsquo;s Creek</i>,
that were Friends to the English therefore
it was the Generals positive Orders, that
they should not be Molested upon any
account, upon the Generals Arrival at the
Fort, He was Saluted with 17. Guns, and
we found 100 Indian Men, Women &amp; Children
with 6 Companies of S<sup>r</sup> Peter Halkets
Regiment, 9 Virginian Companies and a
Maryland Company.</p>

<p>May 11<sup>th</sup>: <i>Fort Cumberland</i>, is Situated
within 200 Yards of <i>Wills Creek</i> on a Hill
400 Yards from the <i>Potomack</i>, it&rsquo;s greatest
length from East to West is 200 Yards, and
breadth 40 it is built with Loggs drove into
the Ground: and 12 feet above it Embrazures
are cut for 12 Guns which are 4.
Pounders, though 10 are only Mounted with
loopholes for small Arms; The Indians
were greatly surprised at the regular way
of our Soldiers Marching and our Numbers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>I would willingly say something of the
customs &amp; manners of them, but they are
hardly to be described. The Men are tall,
well made and Active, but not strong; The
Women not so tall yet well proportion&rsquo;d &amp;
have many Children; they paint themselves
in different Manners; Red, Yellow
&amp; Black intermixt, the Men have the outer
Rim of their Ears cut; and hanging by a
little bit at Top and bottom: they have also
a Tuft of Hair left at Top of their Heads,
dress&rsquo;d with Feathers.... Their Match
Coat which is their chief Cloathing, is a thick
Blanket thrown round them; and instead
of Shoes wear Mekosins, which laces round
the foot and Ankle ... their manner of
carrying Children are by lacing them on a
Board, and tying them with a broad Bandage
with a place to rest their feet, and
Boards over their Heads to keep the Sun
off and this is Slung to the Womens backs.
These people have no Idea of a Superior
Being or of Religion and I take them to be
the most ignorant, as to the Knowledge of
the World and things, of any Creatures
living. When it becomes dark they Return
to their Camp, which is [nigh] Woods, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
Dance for some Time with making the
most hidious Noise.</p>

<p>May 12<sup>th</sup>: Orders for a Council of War
at the Head Quarters when the Indians
came, and were received by the Guard with
Rested Arms, an Interpreter was directed
to tell them that their Brothers, the English,
who were their friends were come to
assist them, that every misunderstanding
in past times, should now be buried under
that great Mountain (which was close by)
and Accordingly the Ceremony was perform&rsquo;d
in giving them a string of Wampum
or Beads; and the following speech was
made, to Assure them that this string or Belt
of Wampum was a suriety of our Friendship;
and likewise a Declaration, that
every one, who were Enemies to them, were
consequently so to us. The Interpretor
likewise assured them, the we had a Considerable
Number of Men to the N<sup>o</sup>Ward,
under the Commands of our great War
Captains Generals, Shirley, Pepperel &amp;
Johnson that were making preparations for
War to settle them happily in their Countries,
and make the French both ashamed
&amp; hungry, however, should any Indians<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
absent themselves they would be deem&rsquo;d
our Enimies &amp; treated as such; The Generals
moreover told them, he should have
presents for them soon, and would then
make them another Speech, after which he
parted with giving a Dram round.</p>

from the <i>Creek</i>, and having all his Forces
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>w<sup>th</sup>. him, found that the Carriages, Pack
horses &amp;c<sup>a</sup>. he had with him, retardid his
Marches greatly, insomuch that in all probability,
the French would be renforced,
before he could possibly get there, provided
he kept the whole Army together&mdash;he
therefore selected 1200 of the Choicest Men
besides Artillery &amp; Seamen with the most
Necessary Stores that might be wanted,
which compleated 51 Carriages, and left
the heavy Baggage Provisions &amp;c<sup>a</sup>. with
Col<sup>o</sup>. Dunbar and the rest of the Forces w<sup>th</sup>.
Orders to follow as fast as possible: then
March&rsquo;d &amp; continued untill 8<sup>th</sup>. July without
Interruption save 8 or 9 Scalps on the
March a Number much inferior to the
Expectations, he Encamp&rsquo;d within 8 Miles
of <i>Fort Dec Quisne</i> where he held a Councill
of War, when it was unaimously agreed
that they should pass the <i>Monongohela</i> River
in the Morning twice and that the advanced
Party should March at 2 o&rsquo;Clock in the
Morning to secure that pass (the River
being very broad and easily defended as
the Fort was very near they thought it
advisable to take that oppertunity, that the
Enemy might not have a View of them,
Therefore the General order&rsquo;d that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
Army should March over with fixt Bayonets
to make a show.</p>

<p>On the 9<sup>th</sup>. July the advanced party of
400 Men March&rsquo;d about 7. o&rsquo;Clock some
Indians Rush&rsquo;d out of the Bushes, but did
no Execution, the Party went on &amp; secured
both passes of the River, and at 11 the
Main Body began to cross with Colours
flying, Drums beating, &amp; Fifes playing the
Granadier&rsquo;s March, and soon formed, when
they thought that the French would not
Attack them, as they might have done it
w<sup>th</sup>. such advantages in crossing the <i>Monogohela</i>,
The advanced party was &frac14; Mile
before the Main Body, the Rear of which
was just over the River, when the Front
was attacked The 2. Granadier Comp<sup>ys</sup>.
formed the Flank The Piquets with the
rest of the Men were Sustaining the Carpenters
while they were cutting the Roads.
The first Fire the Enemy gave was in
Front, &amp; they likewise gaul&rsquo;d the Piquets
in Flank, so that in few Minutes the Granadiers
were nearly cut to pieces and drove
into the greatest Confusion as was Cap<sup>t</sup>.
Polsons Comp<sup>y</sup>. of Carpent<sup>rs</sup>. As soon as
the Main Body heard that the Front was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
Attack&rsquo;d they instantly advanced to secure
them but found them retreating Upon
which, the General Orderd the Artillery
to draw up, &amp; the Battalion to form, by
this time the Enemy had Attacked the
Main Body, which faced to the Right &amp;
left and engaged them, but could not see
whom they Fired at, it was in an open
Road, that the Main Body were drawn up,
but the Trees were excessive thick round
them, And the Enemy had possession of a
Hill to the Right, which consequently was
a great advantage to them, Many Officers
declare, that they never saw above 5 of the
Enemy at one time during the whole Action
Our Soldiers were Encouraged to make
many Attempts by the Officers (who behaved
Gloriously) to take the Hill, but they
had been so intimidated before by seeing
their Comrades Scalp&rsquo;d in their sight and
such Numbers falling, that as they advanced
up towards the Hill and there
Officer&rsquo;s being pict off which was generally
the Case; they turn&rsquo;d to their R<sup>t</sup>. About &amp;
retired down the Hill. When the General
perceived &amp; was convinced that the Soldiers
would not fight in a regular Manner with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>out
Officers, he devided them into small
parties, and endeavour&rsquo;d to surround the
Enemy, but by this time the Major part of
the Officers were either Kill&rsquo;d or Wounded,
and in short the Soldiers were totally deaf
to the Commands &amp; persuasions of the few
Officers that were left unhurt. The General
had 4 Horses shot under him before
he was wounded, which was towards the
latter part of the Action, when he was put
into a Waggon with great dificulty as he
was very Sollicitious for being left in the
Field. The Retreat now became general,
and it was the opinion of many people that
had we greater Numbers, it would have
been just the same thing, as our advanc&rsquo;d
party never regained the Ground they were
first Attacked upon, it was extreamly lucky
they pursued no farther than the first

<h3>THE BATTLE OF THE MONONGAHELA</h3>


<p>Sir Peter Halket moved out from
Fort Cumberland on June 7 with a
brigade comprising the 44th Regiment,
two Independent Companies of New
York, two companies of Virginia Rangers,
one of Maryland Rangers, a total of nine
hundred and eighty-four men, six hundred
woodchoppers under Sir John St. Clair
having been sent forward to widen and
improve Washington&rsquo;s road. The next day
but one Colonel Thomas Dunbar marched
away with another brigade comprising the
48th Regiment, a company of carpenters,
three companies of Virginia Rangers, and
one from South and North Carolina each,
a total of nine hundred and ninety-three
men. On the tenth, Braddock and his
aides and the rest of the army which was
approximately two thousand two hundred
strong&mdash;a force powerful enough to have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
razed Duquesne, Venango, La B&#339;uf,
Presque Isle, and Niagara to the ground&mdash;if
it could have reached them.</p>

<p>This Franklin who secured Braddock
horses and wagons was a prophet. And
once he predicted that this &ldquo;slender line&rdquo;
of an army would be greatly in danger of
Indian ambuscade &ldquo;and be cut, like a
thread, into several pieces, which, from
their distance, cannot come up in time to
support each other.&rdquo; Braddock laughed at
the prophecy, but his army had not been
swallowed up in the gloom of the forests
two days before its line was thinner and
longer than Braddock could ever have
believed. When encamped at night, the
line of wagons compactly drawn together
was half a mile long; in marching order
by day the army was often spread out to a
length of four miles. And even in this
fashion it could only creep along. Halket
with the first division made only five miles
in three days. In ten days Braddock had
only covered the twenty-four miles to Little
Crossings. The road makers followed implicitly
the Indian path where it was possible;
when on the high ground the road<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
was so rugged that many wagons were
entirely demolished and more temporarily
disabled; when off this track in the ravines
they were buried axle deep in the bogs.</p>

<p>To haul the wagons and cannon over this
worst road ever trod Braddock had the poorest
horses available. All the weak, spavined,
wind-broken, and crippled beasts in
Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia were
palmed off on Braddock by unscrupulous
contractors. And horses, dead or dying,
were always left with the demolished
wagons. &ldquo;There has been vile management
in regard to horses,&rdquo; wrote Washington;
before the army had covered one third
of its journey there were not enough to
draw all the wagons, the strongest being
sent back each day to bring up the wagons
left behind the morning before. The continuous
diet of salt meat brought an
epidemic of bloody flux on the army; some
died, many were sick. Washington&rsquo;s strong
system was in the grasp of a fever before
Little Crossings was reached.</p>

<p>The situation now was desperate and
would have appalled a less stubborn man
than Edward Braddock. Acting on Wash<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>ington&rsquo;s
advice he here divided his army,
preparing to push on to Fort Duquesne
with a flying column of fourteen hundred
men. Washington found the first western
river almost dry and reasoned that Riviere
aux B&#339;ufs would be too dry to transport
southward the reinforcements that were
hurrying from Canada.</p>

<p>On the nineteenth, Braddock advanced
with Colonel Halket and Lieutenant Colonels
Burton and Gage and Major Sparks,
leaving Colonel Dunbar and Major Chapman&mdash;to
their disgust&mdash;to hobble on with
the sick and dying men and horses, the sorry
line of wagons creaking under their heavy
loads. The young Virginian Colonel was
left at the very first camp in a raging fever.
Though unable to push on further with
the column that would capture Duquesne,
yet Braddock considerately satisfied the
ambition of Washington by promising that
he should be brought up before the attack
was made. Washington wrote home that
he would not miss the capture of Duquesne
&ldquo;for five hundred pounds!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With the flying column were taken the
Indians that were with the army but which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
numbered less than a dozen. Braddock has
been severely blamed for his neglect of the
Indians, but any earnest study of this campaign
will assure the student that the commanding
general was no more at fault here
than for the failure of the contractors and
the indifference of the colonies. He had
been promised Indians as freely as stores
and horses and wagons. The Indian question
seems to have been handled most
wretchedly since Washington&rsquo;s late campaign.
Through the negligence of the
busy-body Dinwiddie (so eager for so many
unimportant matters) even the majority of
the Indians who served Washington faithfully
and had followed his retreating army
back to Virginia were allowed to drift back
to the French through sheer neglect. As
none of Dinwiddie&rsquo;s promises were fulfilled
in this respect Braddock turned in despair
to Morris for such Ohio Indians as were
living in Pennsylvania. There had been
at least three hundred Indians of the Six
Nations living in that province, but in
April the Pennsylvania Assembly had
resolved to &ldquo;do nothing more for them&rdquo;;
accordingly they went westward and most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
of them joined the French. Morris, however,
urged George Croghan to send word
to the Delawares, Shawanese, Wyandots,
etc., bidding them come and join Braddock&rsquo;s
army. But Croghan brought less
than fifty and Braddock was not destined to
keep all of these, for Colonel Innes, commanding
at Fort Cumberland, not desiring
the Indian families on his hands during the
absence of the fathers, persuaded Braddock
that there were not enough to add to the
fighting strength of the army and that a
few would be as serviceable for spies as
many. Nor was this bad reasoning: Braddock
would have been no better off with
thirty than with ten. The fact is, he was
in nothing deceived more by false promises
and assurances than in the matter of Indian
co&ouml;peration. And was he more at fault
for the lack of frontiersmen? True, he
refused the services of Captain Jack and his
company, but only because the latter
refused to be governed by the discipline to
which the rest of the army was subject;
Braddock could not agree to such an
arrangement and it is doubtful if Washington
would have acted differently under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
similar circumstances. At least the Virginian
had nothing to do with Captain
Jack&rsquo;s renowned company the year before.
To other border fighters Braddock gave a
warm reception; Gist and Croghan, the two
best known men on the frontier, held important
offices in the army. It is as easy
as common to lay at the door of a defeated
and dead commander all the misfortunes of
a campaign; whatever Braddock&rsquo;s errors,
the fact remains that the colonies failed
absolutely to make the least move to provide
an Indian army for Braddock&rsquo;s use.
Nothing could have more surely promised
defeat and disgrace.</p>

<p>The flying column flew like a partridge
with a broken wing. &ldquo;We set out,&rdquo; wrote
Washington who started with it but was
compelled to stop, &ldquo;with less than thirty
carriages, including those that transported
the ammunition for the howitzers, and six-pounders,
and all of them strongly horsed;
which was a prospect that conveyed infinite
delight to my mind, though I was excessively
ill at the time. But this prospect
was soon clouded, and my hopes brought
very low indeed, when I found, that,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
instead of pushing on with vigor, without
regarding a little rough road, they were
halting to level every mole-hill, and to
erect bridges over every brook, by which
means we were four days in getting twelve
miles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the third of July the flying column
had passed the Youghiogheny and were
encamped ten miles north of it, forty miles
from Fort Duquesne. It had not averaged
three miles a day since leaving Little
Crossings! Here a Council of War was
held to decide whether to push on alone
or await the coming of Dunbar and the
wagons. Could the Grenadiers and their
officers have seen through that narrow path
to their destination, how quickly would
their decision have been made, how eagerly
would they have hurried on to the Ohio!
Contrec&#339;ur at Fort Duquesne was in a
miserable plight; every returning red-skin
told of the advance of the great British
army in the face of Governor Duquesne&rsquo;s
proud boast to Vaudreuil that it was impossible
for the English to cross the Alleghenies
in sufficient force to cause uneasiness!
Braddock, despite the utter lack of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
proper support from the colonies, was
accomplishing the eighth wonder of the
world. It was desperate work. But a
Bull-dog was creeping nearer each day.</p>

<p>Throughout the winter the British ministry
and the Court of Versailles had been
exchanging the most ridiculous pretenses
of peace while secretly preparing for war
with dispatch. For every ill-recruited
regiment King George sent to Virginia,
King Louis sent two famous regiments to
Canada, and they arrived there despite
Boscawen, the English admiral, who captured
two unimportant ships. Yet that was
enough to precipitate the struggle and save
more fables from the respective ambassadors;
&ldquo;I will not pardon the piracies of
that insolent nation,&rdquo; exclaimed Louis&mdash;and
open war was inevitable.</p>

<p>At his landing at Quebec Vaudreuil
found not less than twelve thousand soldiers
in Canada to defend the claims of his King.
But that was a long frontier to man, from
Quebec to New Orleans, and in April only
about one thousand men were forwarded to
defend the Ohio river. Of these Contrec&#339;ur
had not more than three hundred, probably<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
less. The summer before he had two thousand
defenders, but Duquesne, blindly
trusting to the ephemeral league he had
made with the Alleghenies, had not been
liberal again. In vain Contrec&#339;ur sent
messages northward to Venango and
Presque Isle. Riviere aux B&#339;ufs was as
dry as the Youghiogheny. Inevitable surrender
or capitulation stared the French
commander in the face. Even the crowds
of Indians within hail were not to be reckoned
on; they were terrified at the proportions
of Braddock&rsquo;s army.</p>

<p>Accordingly, Contrec&#339;ur made his
arrangements for a capitulation, as Washington
had done one year ago. Braddock
had accomplished the impossible; the
Indians were demoralized and took to
&ldquo;cooking and counciling&rdquo;; Fort Duquesne
was as good as captured.</p>

<p>On the seventh Braddock reached Brush
Fork of Turtle Creek, but the country immediately
between him and the Ohio was
so rough that the army turned westward
and pitched its nineteenth encampment in
Long Run valley two miles from the Monongahela.
Here Washington came up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
with the army in a covered wagon, still
weak but ready to move with the army in
the morning and sleep in Duquesne that
night. The whole army was infused with
this hope as the ninth of July dawned.</p>

<p>For no one questioned Braddock&rsquo;s success
if he could once throw that army across the
mountains. No one knew the situation
better than Washington, and early in the
campaign he wrote his brother: &ldquo;As to
any danger from the enemy, I look upon
it as trifling.&rdquo; In London profane wits
cited Scripture (Ezekiel xxxv: 1-10) to
justify the conquest of the Ohio valley:
&ldquo;Moreover, the word of the Lord came
unto me saying, Son of man, set thy face
against Mount Seir and prophesy against it,
and say unto it, thus saith the Lord God:
Behold, O mount Seir, I am against thee
and I will stretch out mine hand against
thee and I will make thee most desolate....
Because thou hast said,
These two nations and these two countries
shall be mine, and we will possess it.&rdquo;
Already subscription papers were being
passed about in Philadelphia to provide
festal fires to illumine the Quaker City<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
when the news of Braddock&rsquo;s victory came.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, the d&mdash;l,&rdquo; exclaimed one of the
enthusiasts to that odd man Franklin who
did not sign his name at once, &ldquo;you surely
don&rsquo;t suppose the fort will not be taken?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know it will not be taken,&rdquo; replied
the Postmaster-General, &ldquo;but I know that
the events of war are subject to great uncertainty.&rdquo;
A jingling ballad in Chester
County, Pennsylvania, was spreading
throughout the frontier. It ran, in part:</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To arms, to arms! my jolly grenadiers!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Hark, how the drums do roll it along!</span><br />

</p>

<p>Before daybreak on the morning of the
fatal ninth Lieutenant Colonel Gage moved
to the Monongahela to secure the two fords
the army was to use on the last day&rsquo;s
march. At four o&rsquo;clock Sir John St. Clair
with two hundred and fifty men went forward
to prepare the roads. At five Braddock
advanced and made the first crossing at
eight o&rsquo;clock. He then formed his army
for a triumphant march to the second ford
and on to Fort Duquesne. It had been
feared that, however weak, Contrec&#339;ur
would attempt to defend this ford of the
Monongahela. But this fear was dissipated
on receipt of the news that Gage held the
second ford.</p>

<p>Contrec&#339;ur knew it would be foolhardy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
to give Braddock battle. He was in no
mind to waste his men futilely. He knew
an honorable capitulation was all for which
he could hope. But on the 8th a captain
of the regulars, M. de Beaujeu, asked leave
to go out with a band to oppose Braddock&rsquo;s
passage of the Monongahela. Reluctantly,
it is said, Contrec&#339;ur gave his permission
and, the whole garrison desiring to attend
Beaujeu, the commander detailed him
selected troops on the condition that he
could obtain the assistance of the Indians
who were about the fort.</p>

<p>The impetuous Beaujeu hurried off to the
Indians and unfolded his plan to them.
But they were afraid of Braddock; some
of them had even gone into the English
camp, at Cumberland, or in the mountains,
on pretense of joining the English army;
they had seen the long lines of grenadiers
and wagons laden with cannon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How, my Father,&rdquo; they replied, &ldquo;are
you so bent upon death that you would also
sacrifice us? With our eight hundred men
do you ask us to attack four thousand
English? Truly, this is not the saying of
a wise man. But we will lay up what we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
have heard, and tomorrow you shall know
our thoughts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Baffled, Beaujeu withdrew while the
redskinned allies of the French frittered
away the hours in debate&mdash;and the spies
brought word that Braddock was encamped
in Long Run valley. The indomitable
Beaujeu, however, went and examined the
ground at the ford of the Monongahela,
which Braddock would pass on the next
day. On the ninth, however, the Indians
brought word that they would not join in
the unequal contest.</p>

<p>But even as they spoke an Indian scout
came running down the narrow trail toward
the fort. He brought the news of Braddock&rsquo;s
advance on the Monongahela fords.
Beaujeu, cunning actor, played his last card
desperately and well:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am determined,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;to go
out against the enemy; I am certain of
victory. What! will you suffer your father
to depart alone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The reproach stung the savage breasts.
In a moment hundreds of hoarse voices
were drowning the long roll of the drums.
A mad scene followed; wild with enthusi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>asm,
casks of bullets and flints and powder
were rolled to fort gates and their heads
knocked out. About these the savages,
even while painting themselves for the
fray, came in crowds, each one free to help
himself as he needed. Then came the
race for the ford of the Monongahela.
Down the narrow trail burst the horde of
warriors, led by the daring Beaujeu dressed
in savage costume, an Indian gorget swinging
from his neck for good fortune. Behind
him poured Delawares, Ojibways, Pottawattamies,
Abenakis, Caughnawagas, Iroquois,
Ottawas, led by their young King
Pontiac; Shawanese, Wyandots, Hurons,
led by Athanasius from the mission of
Lorette, who gloried in a name &ldquo;torn from
the most famous page of Christian history.&rdquo;
With the six hundred savages ran two
hundred Canadians and four score French
regulars.</p>

<p>This rabble could not have left Fort
Duquesne before high noon; no wonder
Beaujeu ran&mdash;fearing Braddock had passed
the battle-ground he had chosen last night.
In that case he despaired of delaying the
advance even a single day; yet in one day<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
the expected reinforcements might arrive
from the north!</p>

<p>Washington rode with Braddock today,
though he rode on a pillow in his saddle.
In after life he often recalled the sight of
Braddock&rsquo;s grenadiers marching beside the
Monongahela in battle array, a fine picture
with the thin red line framed in the fresh
green of the forests. With the receipt of
Gage&rsquo;s note, the fear of ambuscade which
had been omnipresent since the army left
Fort Cumberland, vanished. During that
month the Indian guides, flanking squads,
and woodchoppers had rushed into camp
time and again calling the companies to
arms; each alarm had been false. As Fort
Duquesne was neared Braddock grew doubly
cautious. He even attempted to leave the
Indian trail which ran through the &ldquo;Narrows&rdquo;
and which crossed the Monongahela
at the mouth of Turtle Creek. When another
course was found impossible for the
wagons he turned reluctantly back to the
old thoroughfare, but had passed the &ldquo;Narrows&rdquo;
safely and his advance guards now
held the fords. All was well.</p>

<p>By two o&rsquo;clock Braddock was across the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
river, bag and baggage. Beyond, the Indian
trail wound along to the uplands,
skirting the heads of numerous ravines and
clinging persistently, like all the trails of
the Indians and buffalo, to the high ground
between the brook and swamp. The ridge
which the trail followed here to the second
terrace was twenty rods in width, with the
path near the center. On the west a deep
ravine, completely hidden in the deep
underbrush, lay almost parallel with the
trail for a distance of over five hundred
feet. On the opposite side smaller ravines
also lay nearly parallel with the trail. On
the high ground between these hidden
ravines, and not more than two hundred
feet from them, Braddock&rsquo;s engineers and
woodchoppers widened their road for Gage&rsquo;s
advance guard which was ordered to march
on until three o&rsquo;clock.</p>

<p>As the engineers reached the extremity
of the second terrace Beaujeu came bounding
into sight, the pack of eight hundred
wolves at his heels. Seeing the English,
the daring but dismayed Frenchman
stopped still in his tracks. He was an hour
too late. Attempting to surprise Brad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>dock,
Beaujeu was himself surprised. But
he waved his hat above his head and the
crowd of warriors scattered behind him
like a partridge&rsquo;s brood into the forest
leaves.</p>

<p>The French captain knew the ground
and Braddock did not, and the ground was
admirably formed for a desperate stand
against the advancing army. Burton, who
was just leaving the river shore, was
ordered up to support Gage on the second
upland after the first fire. This brought
the whole army, save four hundred men, to
the second terrace between the unseen
ravines on the east and west. Into these
ravines poured the Indian rabble. The
ravine on the east being shorter than that
on the west, many savages ran through it
and posted themselves in the dense underbrush
on the hillside.</p>

<p>Thus, in a twinkling of an eye, the
Indians running southward in the two
ravines and the British northward on the
high ground between them, the fatal position
of the battle was quickly assumed.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>No encounter has been more incorrectly
described and pictured than the Battle of
the Monongahela.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Braddock was not surprised;
his advance guard saw the enemy
long before they opened fire; George Croghan
affirmed that the grenadiers delivered
their first charge when two hundred yards
distant from the Indians, completely throwing
it away. Nor did Braddock march
blindly into a deep ravine; his army was
ever on the high ground, caught almost in
the vortex of the cross-fire of the savages
hidden on the brink of the ravines on either
side, or posted on the high ground to the
right.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>The road was but twelve feet in width.
Even as Burton came up, Gage&rsquo;s grenadiers
were frightened and retreating. The
meeting of the advancing and retiring
troops caused a fatal confusion and delay
in the narrow road. The fire from the
Indians on the high ground to the right
being severe, Braddock attempted to form
his bewildered men and charge. It was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
futile. The companies were in an inextricable
tangle. Finally, to reduce things
to order, the various standards were advanced
in different directions and the officers
strove to organize their commands in
separate detachments, with a hope of surrounding
the savages. This, too, proved
futile. The Indians on either side completely
hidden in the ravines, the smoke of
the rifles hardly visible through the dense
underbrush, poured a deadly fire on the
swarm of red-coats huddled in the narrow
track. Not a rifle ball could miss its mark
there. As the standards were advanced
here and there, the standard bearers and
the officers who followed encouraging their
men to form again were shot down both
from behind and before.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> As once and
again the paralyzed grenadiers broke into
the forest to raid the ravines, in the vain
hope of dislodging the enemy, they offered
only a surer mark for the thirsty rifles
toward which they ran.</p>

<p>The Virginians took to the trees like
ducks to water, but the sight enraged Braddock,
mad to have the men form in battle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
line and charge in solid phalanx. In vain
Washington pleaded to be allowed to place
his men behind the trees; Braddock drove
them away with the flat blade of his sword.
Yet they came back and fought bravely
from the trees as was their habit. But it
availed nothing to fight behind trees with
the enemy on both flanks; the Virginians
were, after all, no safer there than elsewhere,
as the death-roll plainly shows.
The provincial portion of the army suffered
as heavily, if not more heavily, than any
other. No army could have stood its
ground there and won that battle. The
only chance of victory was to advance or
retreat out of range of those hidden rifles.
The army could not be advanced for every
step brought the men nearer the very center
of that terrible cross-fire. And the
Bull-dog Braddock knew not the word
&ldquo;retreat.&rdquo; That was the secret of his
defeat.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>Soon there were not enough officers left
to command the men, most of whom were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
hopelessly bewildered at seeing half the
army shot down by a foe they themselves
had never seen. Many survivors of the
battle affirmed that they never saw above
five Indians during the conflict. Braddock
was mortally wounded by a ball which
pierced his right arm and lung. Sir Peter
Halket lay dead, his son&rsquo;s dead corpse
lying across his own. Of twenty-one captains,
seven were dead and seven wounded;
of thirty-eight lieutenants, fifteen were
wounded and eleven were dead; of fourteen
second lieutenants or ensigns, five
were wounded and three were dead; of
fifty-eight sergeants, twenty were wounded
and seventeen dead; of sixty-one corporals
and bombardiers, twenty-two were wounded
and eighteen dead; of eighteen gunners,
eight were wounded and six were dead; of
twelve hundred privates, three hundred
and twenty-eight were wounded and three
hundred and eighty-six were dead. Each
Frenchman, Canadian, and Indian had hit
his man and more than every other one had
killed his man. Their own absolutely impregnable
position can be realized when it
is known that not twenty-five French,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
Canadians or Indians were killed and
wounded. Among the first to fall was the
hero of the day, Beaujeu; his Indian gorget
could not save his own life, but it delayed
the capture of Fort Duquesne&mdash;three years.</p>

<p>Yet the stubborn, doomed army held its
ground until the retreat was ordered. The
wounded Braddock, who pleaded, it is said,
to be left upon the ground, and even
begged for Croghan&rsquo;s pistol with which to
finish what a French bullet had begun, was
placed in a cart and afterwards in a wagon
and brought off the field.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> No sooner was
retreat ordered than it became an utter
rout. Some fifty Indians pursued the army
into the river, but none crossed it. Here
and there efforts were made to stem the
tide but to no purpose. The army fled
back to Dunbar, who had now crawled
along to Laurel Hill and was encamped at
a great spring at the foot of what is now
Dunbar&rsquo;s Knob, half a mile north of Jumonville&rsquo;s
hiding place and grave. Dunbar&rsquo;s
situation was already deplorable, even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
Washington having prophesied that,
though he had crossed the worst of the
mountain road, he could never reach Fort
Duquesne.</p>

<p>But as Braddock&rsquo;s demoralized army
threw itself upon him, Dunbar&rsquo;s condition
was indescribably wretched. A large portion
of the survivors of the battle and of
Dunbar&rsquo;s own command, lost to all order,
hurried on toward Fort Cumberland.
Dunbar himself, now senior officer in command,
ordered his cannons spiked and his
ammunition destroyed and, with such
horses as could be of service, began to retreat
across the mountains. For this he
was, and has often been, roundly condemned;
yet, since we have Washington&rsquo;s
plain testimony that he could never have
hauled his wagons and cannon over the
thirty comparatively easy miles to Fort
Duquesne, who can fairly blame him for not
attempting to haul them over the sixty difficult
miles to Fort Cumberland? To fortify
himself, so far removed from hopes of
sustenance and succor, was equally impossible.
There was nothing Dunbar could
do but retreat.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>The dying Braddock, tumbling about in
a covered wagon on the rough road, spoke
little to the few men who remained
faithfully beside him. Only once or twice
in the three days he lived did he speak
of the battle; and then he only sighed
to himself softly: &ldquo;Who would have
thought it?&rdquo; Once, turning to the wounded
Orme, he said: &ldquo;We shall better know
how to deal with them another time.&rdquo;
During his last hours Braddock seems to
have regarded his young Virginian aide,
Washington, whose advice he had followed
only indifferently throughout the campaign,
with utmost favor, bequeathing him his
favorite charger and his servant. On the
night of the twelfth of July, in a camp in
an Indian orchard, near what is now Braddock&rsquo;s
Run, a mile and more east of Fort
Necessity, in Great Meadows, Edward Braddock
died. In the morning he was buried
in the center of the roadway. Undoubtedly
Washington read the service over the
Briton&rsquo;s grave. When the army marched
eastward it passed over the grave, obliterating
its site from even an Indian&rsquo;s keen eye.
In 1823, when the Braddock&rsquo;s Road was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
being repaired, what were undoubtedly his
bones were uncovered, together with military
trappings, etc. These were placed in
the dry ground above the neighboring run,
the spot being now marked by solemn
pines.</p>

<p>Whatever Braddock&rsquo;s faults and foibles,
he accomplished a great feat in leading a
comparatively powerful army across the
Alleghenies, and had he been decently
supported by the colonies, there would
have been no doubt of his success. As it
was, shamefully hampered and delayed by
the procrastinating indifference of the
colonies, deceived and defrauded by wolfish
contractors, abandoned by the Indians
because of the previous neglect of the
Colonial governors and assemblies, nevertheless
the campaign was a distinct success,
until at the last moment, Fate capriciously
dashed the chalice from Braddock&rsquo;s lips.</p>

<p>The shattered army reached Fort Cumberland
on July 20. The tale of disaster
had preceded it. The festal fires were
not kindled in Philadelphia. Now, for the
first time the colonies were awakened to
the true situation, and in the months<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
following paid dearly for their supine indifference.</p>

<p>For with Beaujeu&rsquo;s victory the French
arms became impregnable on the Ohio.
Braddock&rsquo;s defeat brought ten-fold more
wretchedness than his victory could ever
have brought of advantage. After that
terrible scene of savagery at Fort Duquesne
on the night of the victory, when
the few prisoners taken were burned at the
stake, there were no wavering Indians.
And instantly the frontier was overrun with
marauding bands which drove back to the
inhabited parts of the country every advanced
settlement. All the Virginian
outposts were driven in; and even the
brave Moravian missionaries in Pennsylvania
and New York gave up their work
before the red tide of war which now set
eastward upon the long frontiers.</p>

<p>For Shirley had likewise been beaten
back from Fort Niagara, and Johnson had
not captured Fort Crown Point. Two of
the campaigns of 1755 were utter failures.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>A DESCRIPTION OF THE BACKWOODS</h3>


<p>The clearest insight into the days when
Braddock&rsquo;s Road was built, and the
most vivid pictures of the country
through which it wound its course, are
given in certain letters of a British officer
who accompanied Braddock. No treatise
on Braddock&rsquo;s expedition could be in any
measure complete without reproducing
this amusing, interesting, yet pitiful testimony
to the difficulties experienced by
these first English officers to enter the
backwoods of America. This is given in a
volume entitled <i>Extracts of Letters from an
officer in one of those Regiments to his friend
in London</i>, published in London in the year
of Braddock&rsquo;s Defeat:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You desire me to let you know the
Particulars of our Expedition, and an
Account at large of the Nature of the
Country, and how they live here; also of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
the Manner of the Service, and which
Corps is the most agreeable to serve in,
because it has been proposed to you to
strive to buy a Commission here, and that
you awaited my Advice to determine.
Dear Sir, I love you so well that I shall at
once tell you, I reckon the Day I bought
my Commission the most unhappy in my
Life, excepting that in which I landed in
this Country. As for the Climate, it is
excessive hot in Summer, and as disagreeably
cold in Winter, and there is no Comfort
in the Spring; none of those Months
of gentle genial Warmth, which revives all
Nature, and fills every Soul with vernal
Delight; far from this, the Spring here is
of very few Days, for as soon as the severe
Frosts go off, the Heat of the neighbouring
Sun brings on Summer at once, one Day
shall be Frost, and the next more scorching
or sultry and faint than the hottest Dog-Day
in <i>England</i>. What is excessively disagreeable
here is, that the Wealth of the
Country consists in Slaves, so that all one
eats rises out of driving and whipping these
poor Wretches; this Kind of Authority so
Corrupts the Mind of the Masters, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
makes them so overbearing, that they are
the most troublesome Company upon Earth,
which adds much to the Uncomfortableness
of the Place. You cannot conceive how it
strikes the Mind on the first Arrival, to
have all these black Faces with grim Looks
round you, instead of being served by
blooming Maid Servants, or genteel white
Livery Men: I was invited to Supper by a
rich Planter, and the Heat of the Climate,
the dim Light of the Myrtle Wax-Candles,
and the Number of black half-naked Servants
that attended us, made me think of
the infernal Regions, and that I was at
Supper with <i>Pluto</i>, only there was no beautiful
<i>Proserpine</i>, for the Lady of the House
was more like one of the Furies; she had
passed through the Education of the College
of <i>Newgate</i>, as great Numbers from
thence arrive here yearly; Most being cunning
Jades, some pick up foolish Planters;
this Lady&rsquo;s Husband was far from a Fool,
but had married, not only for the Charms
of her Person, but because her Art and
Skill was Quite useful to him in carrying
on his Business and Affairs, many of which
were worthy of an adept in the College she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
came from. Among others he made me
pay for my Supper by selling me a Horse
upon Honour, which, as soon as it was cool,
shewed itself Dog-lame and Moon-blind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As for eating, they have the Names of
almost every Thing that is delicious, or in
Fashion in <i>England</i>, but they give them to
Things as little like as <i>C&aelig;sar</i> or <i>Pompey</i>
were to the <i>Negroes</i> whom they call by
those <i>Names</i>. For what they call a Hare
is a Creature half Cat, half Rabbet, with
white strong Flesh, and that burrows in
rotten Trees; they call a Bird not much
bigger than a Fieldfare, with hard, dry,
strong Flesh, hardly eatable, a Partridge.
The best Thing they have is a wild Turky,
but this is only in Season one Month in the
Year; the rest it is hard, strong, and dry.
As for Beef, the Months of <i>October</i> and
<i>November</i> excepted, it is Carrion; that is to
say, so lean as it would not be called Meat
in <i>England</i>; their Mutton is always as
strong Goats&rsquo; Flesh; their Veal is red and
lean, and indeed the Heat of the Summer
and the pinching Frost of Winter, makes
all like <i>Pharaoh&rsquo;s</i> lean Kine. They brag of
the Fruits, that they have such plenty of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
Peaches as to feed Hogs; and indeed that
is true, they are fit for nothing else; I do
not remember, among the Multitudes I
have tasted, above one or two that were
eatable, the rest were either mealy or
choaky. Melons grow in Fields, and are
plentier than Pumpkins in <i>England</i>, as large
and as tasteless; there are such Quantities
that the Houses stink of them; the Heat of
the Country makes them at once mellow,
so that they hardly ever have the fine racy
Taste of an <i>English</i> good Melon, for in
<i>England</i> you have many bad Melons to
one good; but here the Heat makes all
Fruits like us young fellows, rotten before
they are ripe. With respect to Fish, they
have neither Salmon, Carp, Trout, Smelts,
nor hardly any one good Kind of Fish.
They give the Name of Trout to a white
Sea-fish, no more like a Trout than a Cat
to a Hare; they have one good, nay excellent
Kind of Fish, I mean a Turtle; but as
Scarce as in <i>England</i>. With respect to
public Diversions, the worst <i>English</i> Country
Town exceeds all they have in the
whole Province. As to Drink, <i>Burgundy</i>
and <i>Champaign</i> were scarce ever heard of;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
<i>Claret</i> they have but poor Stuff, tawny and
prick&rsquo;d, for it cannot stand the Heat of the
Summer, which also spoils the <i>Port</i>; the
<i>Madeira</i> is the best Wine they have, but
that only of the worst Growths, for the
best are sent to <i>Jamaica</i> or <i>England</i>; their
only tolerable Drink is Rum Punch, which
they swill Morning, Noon, and Night.
Their Produce is Tobacco; they are so
attached to that, and their Avarice to raise
it, makes them neglect every Comfort of
Life; But the Intemperance of the Climate
affects not only all the Cattle, Fruits, and
Growths of the Country, but the human
Race; and it is rare to see a native reach
50 Years of Age. I have heard from the
best Judges, I mean the kind hearted
Ladies most in Vogue, that a <i>Virginian</i> is
old at 30, as an <i>Englishman</i> is at 60. The
Ladies I speak of are well experienced,
and for most of them the Public have for
peculiar Merit paid the Passage, and honoured
with an Order for Transportation on
Record. I would not deceive you so have
told you the truth; I have not exaggerated,
but have omitted many disagreeable Circumstances,
such as Thunder Storms,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
Yellow Fevers, Musketoes, other Vermin,
<i>&amp;c</i> with which I shall not trouble you.
The Ship is just going.&rdquo;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>&ldquo;I Sent a Letter to you by Captain <i>Johnson</i>
bound for <i>Bristol</i>, with a full Account
of the Country, by which you will see the
Reasons why it will be highly improper for
you to buy into the Troops here; I send
this by a Ship bound for <i>London</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They make here a Division between
the Settlements and the Woods, though the
Settlements are what we should call very
woody in <i>Europe</i>. The Face of the Country
is entirely different from any Thing I ever
saw before; the Fields have not the Appearance
of what bears that Name in
<i>Europe</i>, instead of ploughed Grounds or
Meadows, they are all laid out in Hillocks,
each of which bears Tobacco Plants, with
Paths hoed between. When the Tobacco
is green it looks like a Coppice; when
pulled the Ground looks more like Hop-Yards
than Fields, which makes a very
disagreeable Appearance to the Eye. The
Indian Corn also, and all their Culture runs
upon hilling with the Hoe, and the <i>Indian</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
Corn grows like Reeds to eight or nine
Feet high. Indeed in some Parts of the
Country Wheat grows, but Tobacco and
<i>Indian</i> Corn is the chief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From the Heart of the Settlements we
are now got into the Cow-Pens, the Keepers
of these are very extraordinary Kind of
Fellows, they drive up their Herds on
Horseback, and they had need do so, for
their Cattle are near as wild as Deer; a
Cow-Pen generally consists of a very large
Cottage or House in the Woods, with about
four-score or one hundred Acres, inclosed
with high Rails and divided; a small Inclosure
they keep for Corn, for the Family,
the rest is the Pasture in which they keep
their Calves; but the Manner is far different
from any Thing you ever saw; they
may perhaps have a Stock of four or five
hundred to a thousand Head of Cattle
belonging to a Cow-Pen, these run as they
please in the great Woods, where there are
no Inclosures to stop them. In the Month
of <i>March</i> the Cows begin to drop their
Calves, then the Cow-Pen Master, with all
his Men, rides out to see and drive up the
Cows with all their new fallen Calves;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
they being weak cannot run away so as to
escape, therefore are easily drove up, and
the Bulls and other Cattle follow them;
then they put these Calves into the Pasture,
and every Morning and Evening suffer the
Cows to come and suckle them, which done
they let the Cows out into the great Woods
to shift for their Food as well as they can;
whilst the Calf is sucking one Tit of the
Cow, the Woman of the Cow-Pen is milking
one of the other Tits, so that she steals
some Milk from the Cow, who thinks she
is giving it to the Calf; as soon as the Cow
begins to go dry, and the Calf grows
Strong, they mark them, if they are Males
they cut them, and let them go into the
Wood. Every Year in <i>September</i> and <i>October</i>
they drive up the Market Steers, that
are fat and of a proper Age, and kill them;
they say they are fat in <i>October</i>, but I am
sure they are not so in <i>May</i>, <i>June</i> and <i>July</i>;
they reckon that out of 100 Head of Cattle
they can kill about 10 or 12 Steers, and
four or five Cows a Year; so they reckon
that a Cow-Pen for every 100 Head of
Cattle brings about 40&pound; Sterling per Year.
The Keepers live chiefly upon Milk, for out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
of their vast Herds, they do condescend to
tame Cows enough to keep their Family in
Milk, Whey, Curds, Cheese and Butter;
they also have Flesh in Abundance such as
it is, for they eat the old Cows and lean
Calves that are like to die. The Cow-Pen
Men are hardy People, are almost continually
on Horseback, being obliged to know
the Haunts of their Cattle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, Sir, what a wild set of Creatures
our <i>English</i> Men grow into, when
they lose Society, and it is surprising to
think how many Advantages they throw
away, which our industrious Country-Men
would be glad of: Out of many hundred
Cows they will not give themselves the
trouble of milking more than will maintain
their Family.&rdquo;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>&ldquo;Since my last, we are got out of the
Settlements and into the Woods. The
Scene is changed, but not for the better.
I thought we were then so bad that we
had the Consolation of being out of Danger
of being worse, but I found myself mistaken.
The mutinous Spirit of the Men
encreases, but we will get the better of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
that; we will see which will be tired first,
they of deserving Punishments, or we of
inflicting them. I cannot but say the very
Face of the Country is enough to strike a
Damp in the most resolute Mind; the
Fatigues and Wants we suffer, added, are
enough to dispirit common Men; nor
should I blame them for being low spirited,
but they are mutinous, and this came from
a higher Spring than the Hardships here,
for they were tainted in <i>Ireland</i> by the factious
Cry against the L&mdash; L&mdash; Ld G&mdash;, and
the Primate; the wicked Spirit instilled
there by Pamphlets and Conversation, got
amongst the common Soldiers, who, tho&rsquo;
they are <i>Englishmen</i>, yet are not the less
stubborn and mutinous for that. They
have the Impudence to pretend to judge of
and blame every Step, not only of the Officers,
but of the Ministry. They, every
now and then, in their Defence say they
are free <i>Englishmen</i>, and Protestants, and are
not obliged to obey Orders if they are not
fed with Bread, and paid with Money; now
there is often only Bills to pay them with,
and no Bread but <i>Indian</i> Corn. In fine, in
<i>Europe</i> they were better fed than taught;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
now they must be better taught than fed.
Indeed the Officers are as ill off about Food
as they, the General himself, who understands
good eating as well as any Man,
cannot find wherewithal to make a tolerable
Dinner of, though he hath two good Cooks
who could make an excellent Ragout out of
a Pair of Boots, had they but Materials to
toss them up with; the Provision in the
Settlements was bad, but here we can get
nothing but <i>Indian</i> Corn, or mouldy Bisket;
the fresh Bread we must bake in Holes in
the Ground having no Ovens, so besides
the Mustiness of the Flour, it is half Sand
and Dirt. We are happy if we can get
some rusty salt Pork, or Beef, which hath
been carried without Pickle; for as we
cannot carry Barrels on Horses, we are
forced to take out the Meat and put it in
Packs on Horses Backs; sometimes we get
a few live Cattle from the Cow-Pens, but
they are so lean that they are Carion and
unwholesome. To this is added, the Heat
of the Country, which occasions such Faintness,
that the Men can hardly carry their
Arms; and sometimes when these Heats are
a little relaxed, there comes such Storms of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
Rain, Thunder and Lightening, that all the
Elements seems on Fire; Numbers of Pine
Trees struck to Shivers, and such Effects
of Lightening, that if not seen one could
hardly believe; yet we have not as yet had
one Man killed by Lightening, but we have
had several died by the Bite of Snakes,
which are mortal, and abound prodigiously
in the Swamps, through which we are often
forced to march; there is another Inconveniency,
which, tho it seems small, has been
as teasing to me as the greater, that is a
Kind of Tick, or Forest Bug, that gets into
the Legs, and occasions Inflammations and
Ulcers, so that the wound itches and makes
one ready to tear off the Flesh; this hath
greatly distressed both Men and Officers,
and there is no Help nor Cure for it but
Patience: Indeed they seldom occasion
Lameness, tho&rsquo; sometimes they do; a Soldier
of our Company was forced to have
his Leg cut off, for the Inflammation caused
by the many Bites mortifying. We have
nothing round us but Trees, Swamps, and
Thickets. I cannot conceive how we must
do if we are attacked, nor how we can get
up to attack; but the best is what the Gen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>eral
said, to reassure the old Soldiers who
are all uneasy for Fear of being attack&rsquo;d
on the long March in Defiles, his Excellency
with great Judiciousness says, that
where the Woods are too thick so as to
hinder our coming at them, they will hinder
their coming at us.</p>

</div>

<p>&ldquo;Just as I write this we hear the best
News I ever heard in my Life, the General
hath declared to the <i>Virginians</i>, that if they
do not furnish us with Waggons and Provisions
in two Days, he will march back;
he has justly upbraided them for exposing
the King&rsquo;s Troops, by their Bragging and
false Promises. They undertook to furnish
us with Horses, Bread and Beef, and really
have given nothing but Carion for Meat,
<i>Indian</i> Corn for Bread, Jades for Horses
which cannot carry themselves. These
Assurances of furnishing every Thing has
deceived the General hitherto, and he, out
of Zeal for the Service, hath undergone the
utmost Difficulties; but now it is impossible
to go farther without they comply with
the Promises, they were weak, or wicked
enough to make, for certainly they were
never able to perform them; it is surprizing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
how they bragged before we left the Settlements,
of what Plenty they would furnish
us with at the Cow-Pens, and in the Woods;
these Assurances has brought the General
into the present Difficulties, and he has
very justly told them, that if he marched
any farther without a Supply, he should be
justly charged with destroying his Majesty&rsquo;s
Troops in the Deserts, and thereby
occasion the Destruction of <i>Virginia</i> by
encouraging the French; that if he was
not supplied in two Days, he would march
back, and lay their Breach of Faith before
his Majesty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I now begin to hope that I shall once
more have the Pleasure of seeing you, and
the rest of my Friends. Pray acquaint my
dear Mr. M&mdash;, that I desire he would not
sell my Farm at &mdash;, since I hope soon to
be over.&rdquo; [The rest relates to private
affairs].</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>&ldquo;As the Intention of marching back
continues, another Courier is to be sent,
which Opportunity I take, not only to let
you know I am well, but to desire my
Cousin &mdash; would not send any Money to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
Mr. &mdash; to be remitted to me in <i>Virginia</i>. As
the Pen is in my Hand, I will give you
an Account of a Diversion we had some
Nights ago, it was an <i>Indian</i> Dancing,
which I cannot call a Ball, though it was a
Kind of Masquerade, the Habits being very
antick; but this as every Thing in this
Country is, was in the Stile of the Horrible;
the Sal de Ball was covered with the
Canopy of Heaven, and adorned with the
twinkling Stars, a large Space of Grass was
mark&rsquo;d out for the Dancing-Place, round
which we the Spectators stood, as at a
Cricket-match in <i>England</i>, in the Centre of
it was two Fires, at a small Distance from
each other, which were designed as an
Illumination to make the Dancers visible;
near the Fires was seated the Musick,
which were a number of Men and Women,
with a Kind of Timbrels or small Kettle-Drums,
made of real brass Kettles, covered
with Deer Skins made like Parchment by
the <i>Indians</i>, and these they beat, and keep
good Time, although their Tunes are terrible
and savage; they also sing much in
the same Stile, creating Terror, Fear, and
all dreadful Passions, but no pleasing ones.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
After this Noise had gone on for some
Time, at once we heard a most dreadful
Shout, and a Band of horrid Figures rushed
into the Ring, with a Nimbleness hardly
conceivable; they struck the Ground in
exact Measure, answering the rough Musick;
at once all the Descriptions of the
Fawns and Satyrs of the <i>Latin</i> Poets came
into my Mind, and indeed the <i>Indians</i>
seemed to be the same Kind of brown
dancing People, as lived under King <i>Faunus</i>,
some 3000 Years ago in <i>Italy</i>; they are
most chearful and loving to their Friends,
but implacable and cruel to their Enemies.
They drink and act when drunk much like
<i>Silenus</i> and his Satyrs; their whole Life is
spent in Hunting, War, and Dancing, what
they now perform&rsquo;d was a War Dance; as
soon as this Surprize ceased the Dancers
followed one another, treading a large
Ring, round the two Fires and Music, and
ceased Singing; the Timbrels and Voices
in the Centre set up a Tune to which they
continued dancing, and follow&rsquo;d one another
in the Ring with a very true Measure,
antick Postures, and high Bounds, that
would puzzle our best Harlequins to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
imitate; soon after, to every five Dancers
came out a Boy, carrying in their Hands
flaming Splinters of light Wood instead of
Torches, which cast a glim Light that made
Things as distinguishable as at Noon-Day;
and indeed the Surprisingness and Newness
of the Spectacle made it not unpleasing;
the Indians being dress&rsquo;d, some in Furrs,
some with their Hair ornamented with
Feathers, others with the Heads of Beasts;
their Bodies naked, appearing in many
Places, painted with various Colours, and
their Skins so rubbed with Oyl as to glitter
against the Light; their Waists were girded
round with Bear or Deer Skins with the
Hair on, and artificial Tails fixed to many
of them that hung down near unto the
Ground. After they had danced some
Time in a Ring, the Music ceased, the
Dancers divided into two Parties, and set
up the most horrid Song or Cry, that ever
I heard, the Sound would strike Terror into
the stoutest Heart. They then formed
themselves into two Bodies, four deep, all
which they did, still dancing to the Tune
and Measure; they ceased singing, and the
Music began, on which the two Bodies run<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
in at each other, acting all the Parts the
<i>Indians</i> use in their Manner of Fight, avoiding
Shot, and striving to surround their
Enemies. Some Time past in this Manner,
and then at the Signal of a dismal Cry the
Dancers all at once rushed out again, leaving
one only behind them, who was supposed
to have mastered his Enemy; he
struck the Ground with his Tomohawk or
Club, as if he was killing one lying there,
then acting the Motions of scalping, and
then holding up a real dried Scalp, which
before hung upon him amongst his Ornaments;
he then sung out the great Achivements
which some of their Nation had
performed against the <i>French</i>, told the
Names of the <i>Indian</i> Warriors, and how
many of <i>French</i> each had scalped, and then
the Dance ended, <i>&amp;c</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>&ldquo;In my last I acquainted you with the
joyful News that our General resolved not
to be any longer deceived by the <i>Virginians</i>,
Orders were given for our March back, but
the Day before that was appointed there
arrived five Quakers decently dressed, they
were pure plump Men, on brave fat Horses,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
which, by the way, were the first plump
Creatures I had seen in this Country.
Then, as I told you before, I believed <i>Virginia</i>
was peopled by <i>Pharaoh&rsquo;s</i> lean Kine,
but these Quakers seem to come from the
Land of <i>Goshen</i>, they looked like Christian
People; they went directly to his Excellence,
and Curiosity carried us all to the
general Quarters. They came with Thanks
to the General from the People of Pensilvania,
for the great Labour he had gone
through in advancing so far into the Wilderness
for the Protection of his Majesty&rsquo;s
dutiful Subjects. They acquainted him
further, that they had been cutting Roads
to meet him with a Number of Waggons
loaded with Flour, Cheese, Bacon, and
other Provision; though this was good
News I did not half like it, I fear&rsquo;d it
would occasion our Stay, and prevent our
marching back; besides it was ominous,
your Cheese and your Bacon being the
Baits that draw Rats to Destruction, and it
proved but too true; this Bait drew us into
a Trap where happy was he that came off
with the Loss of his Tail only. This
Evening we saw the Road and Waggons,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
and the Men eat, this was a Duty so long
disused, that it was a Tour of Fatigue to
the Teeth. The Fellows who drove the
Waggons, tho&rsquo; they would have made but
a shabby Figure amongst our <i>Hampshire</i>
Carters, yet here they looked like Angels,
compared with the long, lank, yellow-faced
<i>Virginians</i>, who at best are a half-starved,
ragged, dirty Set; if by Accident they can
clear enough by their Tobacco to buy a
Coat, they rather chuse a half-wore gaudy
Rag, than a substantial coarse Cloth, or
Kersey; they are the very Opposites to the
<i>Pensilvanians</i>, who buy Coats of Cloth so
strong as to last as long as the Garments of
the <i>Israelites</i> in their March through the
Desert; a Coat serves a Man for his Life
and yet looks fresh, but this comes from
their never wearing them at Home; when
out of Sight they work half naked. They
are a very frugal People, and if they were
not so would be as beggarly as their Neighbours
the <i>Virginians</i>. The Ground does
not bear half the Crops as in <i>England</i>; they
have no Market but by Sea, and that very
dull, if you consider they are forced to put
their Flour in Barrels after grinding and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
sifting, all at their own Charge, and no
Consideration thereof in the Price; whilst
the <i>English</i> Farmer only threshes his
Wheat, and sends it to Market. Tho&rsquo; <i>Pensilvania</i>
is a Paradise to <i>Virginia</i>, it is a very
poor Country compared to <i>England</i>, and no
Man in his Senses can live with Comfort in
<i>England</i> stays here; as soon as they get
Estates they come over to <i>England</i>. The
Proprietor, a most worthy Gentleman, and
universally admired, went over, and out of
Complaisance staid a little Time with
them, but soon returned back to <i>England</i>,
where he resides. If <i>Pennsylvania</i> could be
agreeable to any one, it would be so to
him, who is one of the most amiable Men
living, and the whole People used their
utmost Endeavors to make the Place agreeable;
but alas, the Intemperature of the
Climate, the Nearness and Frugality in
their Manner of Living, necessary to carry
on the Cultivation; the Labor that most
are forced to undergo to live, prevent their
giving Way to Pleasure, and the rest, as
soon as they by Labor and Frugality get
enough to come to <i>England</i>, leave that
Country, so there are not People enough at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
Ease to make an agreeable Society; nor to
occasion those Improvements in Gardens,
Buildings, and Parks, as would make Life
agreeable, much less is their Numbers
enough of Rich to afford encouragement to
support public Diversions; so that <i>America</i>
is a very disagreeable Place, the least Shire-Town
in <i>England</i> has more Pleasures than
the best Town in <i>North America</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But to return to our Quakers, the Chief
of them told the General that he feared
greatly for the Safety of the Army; that
the Woods, the farther we went, would be
the more dangerous, and the <i>French</i> were a
subtle and daring Enemy, and would not
neglect any Opportunity of surprising us;
that the further we went the more difficult
it would be to supply us with Provisions,
and that the Country was not worth keeping,
much less conquering. The <i>French</i>
not yet knowing our Force were in Terror,
and if he sent would perhaps come into a
Treaty; that Peace was a heavenly Thing;
and as for the Country in Dispute it was
misrepresented by those Projectors, who
had some private Advantage; for it was fit
for none but <i>Indians</i>, the Soil bad, far from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
the Sea, and Navigation; therefore he
thought if the <i>French</i> would abandon and
destroy their Forts, and we do the same,
and leave the Lands to their rightful Owners
the <i>Indians</i>, on Condition that that Nation
should pay some Furrs and Deer Skins, by
Way of Tribute, to our most gracious King
<i>George</i>, a Pacification might be established
till the Matter was made up before his
Majesty. That General <i>Oglethorp</i> had in
that Manner settled all Differences with the
<i>Spaniards</i> on the Southern Frontiers,
towards <i>Florida</i>, and the Accord lasted to
this Day; on the other Hand, he said, that
if the <i>French</i> refused, then the <i>Indians</i>, who
are a free and warlike Nation, and much
too powerful to be despised, would probably
take our Side; if we would pull down
the <i>French</i> Forts, and our own also, they
would be the guard of our Colonies with
very small Expense to <i>England</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The General not only heard this Proposal
with Pleasure, and communicated it
to most of the Officers, but doubted if he
had Power to execute it. Some of the
Braggadocio <i>Virginians</i>, who last Year ran
away so stoutly, began to clamor against<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
the Quakers and the General; so we
marched on; the General got as far as the
Meadows, where, to hasten our March, he
fortified and intrenched a Camp, and left
the heavy Baggage, sick Men, and spare
Provision <i>&amp;c</i>, and to cover our Communication,
he left Colonel <i>Dunbar</i> with 800
Men. This place was the only one where
regular Troops could make Use of their
Discipline and Arms, and it is all open
Ground, therefore the General made this
Camp as a Place of Arms, where a Fortification
being erected would supply the
Army as they should want, and might
receive, and lay up the Provisions in
Safety, as they arrived from <i>Pennsylvania</i>;
the General also said, that as this Place
was on the West Side of the <i>Allegane</i>
Mountains, it preserved his Majesty&rsquo;s
Rights against the <i>French</i>, who pretended
that those Mountains bounded his Majesty&rsquo;s
Dominions. Here we halted and refreshed
ourselves bravely, by the Help of the
<i>Pensilvania</i> Provisions, and of Deer, wild
Turkeys, and Game of several other Kinds
brought in by the <i>Indians</i>, which though
we should deem it bad enough in <i>England</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
for there is not above one Deer in ten that
is fat, yet here our former Wants made
these delicious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the 4th of <i>July</i> our <i>Indians</i> were
defeated in the Woods by the <i>French</i> Parties;
a few only was killed, but their chief
Man was taken; the <i>French</i> have treated
them very kindly, and declare they intend
no War against the <i>Indians</i>. The General
is apprehensive this will make an ill Impression
on them, therefore does not care to
trust them any further; he has publickly
said he will advance himself with 1200
Men, drive the Enemy out of the Woods,
and invest <i>Fort Du Quesne</i>; he is resolved
to be prepared for all Accidents, therefore
leaves Colonel <i>Dunbar</i> with a strong Party
to make good this Camp. The Ground
round the Camp is open, and the Situation
so advantageous, that this Camp is defensible
against all the Efforts the <i>French</i> can
make, if any Accident, should happen to
the General; and he has declared, he has
put it in this Condition, that his Majesty&rsquo;s
Affairs may not suffer if he should miscarry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The General seems very anxious about
marching through the Woods, and gave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
very particular Orders; Powder and Bullet
were given out, and every Thing fit for
Action; two Lieutenant-Colonels were
ordered to command the advanced Party.
The General followed with the Gross of
the two Regiments from <i>Europe</i>, the <i>Americans</i>
followed, and the Rear was brought
up by Captain <i>Dumary&rsquo;s</i>, and another
Independent Company. We marched on
in this Manner without being disturbed,
and thought we had got over our greatest
Difficulties, for we look&rsquo;d upon our March
through the Woods to be such: We were
sure we should be much above a Match for
the <i>French</i>, if once we got into the open
Ground near the Forts, where we could
use our Arms. We had a Train, and a
gallant Party of Sailors for working our
Guns, full sufficient to master better works
than those of the <i>French</i> Forts, according to
the Intelligence we had of them. Then we
march&rsquo;d on, and when within about ten
Miles of Fort <i>Du Quesne</i>, we were, on a
sudden, charged by Shot from the Woods.
Every Man was alert, did all we could, but
the Men dropped like Leaves in <i>Autumn</i>,
all was Confusion, and in Spight of what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
the Officers and bravest Men could do,
Numbers run away, nay fired on us, that
would have forced them to rally. I was
wounded in one Leg, and in the other
Heel, so could not go, but sat down at the
Foot of a Tree, praying of every one that
run by, that they would help me off; an
<i>American Virginian</i> turned to me, Yes,
Countryman, says he, I will put you out
of your Misery, these Dogs shall not burn
you; he then levelled his Piece at my Head,
I cried out and dodged him behind the
Tree, the Piece went off and missed me,
and he run on; soon after Lieutenant <i>Grey</i>,
with a Party of <i>Dumary&rsquo;s</i> Company came
by, who brought up the Rear; the Firing
was now Quite ceased, he told me the General
was wounded, and got me carried off.
When we arrived at the <i>Meadows</i>, we found
Colonel <i>Dunbar</i> did not think it expedient
to wait for the <i>French</i> there, but retired,
and carried us, the wounded, with him to
<i>Will&rsquo;s Creek</i>. I have writ till I am faint.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>SPARKS AND ATKINSON ON BRADDOCK&rsquo;S
ROUTE<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></h3>


<p>Several months ago we received from
that indefatigable delver in the early
annals of our country, Jared Sparks,
Esq., of Salem, Massachusetts, a letter containing
some valuable information as to
the route of General Braddock after leaving
Gist&rsquo;s farm, not far from where Connelsville
now stands. That letter we, for
reasons which it is unnecessary to mention,
have withheld from publication; but those
reasons no longer existing, we now publish
it&mdash;premising only a few introductory
remarks.</p>

<p>Mr. Sparks, as the biographer of Washington
and as the collator of his papers,
and as a most indefatigable searcher after
the whole truth in our early history, en<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>joyed
extraordinary advantages, so that his
statements in all such matters should
always command the utmost confidence.
There is in the possession of the Pennsylvania
Historical Society a draught of &ldquo;the
Monongahela and Youghiogany rivers&rdquo;
taken by Joseph Shippen, Jr., in 1759.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
On this draught the route of General
Braddock is distinctly laid down from
Cumberland to Stewart&rsquo;s Crossings, now
Connelsville, and thence to a point about
twelve or fourteen miles, nearly due north,
and of course some four or five miles east
of the Youghiogany. From that point the
line of march is not laid down until within
about six miles of the Monongahela river, at
Braddock&rsquo;s first ford, about one mile and a
half below McKeesport; from that point it
is distinctly traced across the Monongahela
twice to the field of battle. As Mr. Shippen
was Brigade Major in General Forbes&rsquo;
army, and in that capacity visited this
place within four years after Braddock&rsquo;s
defeat, we may well suppose that he had
accurate information as to the route of that
unfortunate General.</p>

<p>Extract of a letter from Jared Sparks,
Esq., to the editor of the <i>Olden Time</i>.</p>

<p style='text-align: right'>
&ldquo;Salem, Mass., Feb. 18th, 1847. &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />
</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear Sir:&mdash;There is a copy of the
&lsquo;Memorial&rsquo; which you mentioned in the
Library of Harvard College which I believe
is complete. I shall obtain it soon,
and will have the missing pages copied and
forward to you the manuscript. I suppose
you wish it sent by mail. I once compared
this translation with the original<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> and
found it clumsily executed, but the substance
is probably retained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Having heretofore examined with care
the details of Braddock&rsquo;s expedition, I am
persuaded that the following, as far as it
goes, is a correct account of his march from
Gist&rsquo;s plantation:</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the 30th of June the army forded
the Youghiogany at Stewart&rsquo;s Crossings
and then passed a rough road over a mountain.
A few days onward they came to a
great swamp which detained them part
of a day in clearing a road. They next
advanced to Salt Lick Creek, now called
Jacob&rsquo;s Creek, where a council of war was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
held on the 3d of July to consider a suggestion
of Sir John St. Clair that Colonel
Dunbar&rsquo;s detachment should be ordered to
join the main body. This proposal was
rejected on the ground that Dunbar could
not join them in less than thirteen days;
that this would cause such a consumption
of provisions as to render it necessary to
bring forward another convoy from Fort
Cumberland; and that in the meantime the
French might be strengthened by a reinforcement,
which was daily expected at Fort
Duquesne&mdash;and moreover; the two divisions
could not move together after their
junction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the 4th the army again marched
and advanced to Turtle Creek, about twelve
miles from its mouth, where they arrived
on the 7th inst. I suppose this to have
been the eastern branch or what is now
called Rush Creek, and that the place at
which they encamped was a short distance
northerly from the present village of
Stewartsville. It was General Braddock&rsquo;s
intention to cross Turtle Creek, and approach
Fort Duquesne on the other side;
but the banks were so precipitous, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
presented such obstacles to crossing with
his artillery and heavy baggage that he
hesitated, and Sir John St. Clair went out
with a party to reconnoitre. On his return,
before night, he reported that he had found
the ridge which led to Fort Duquesne but
that considerable work would be necessary
to prepare a road for crossing Turtle Creek.
This route was finally abandoned, and on
the 8th the army marched eight miles and
encamped not far from the Monongahela,
west of the Youghiogany and near what is
called in an old map &lsquo;Sugar Run.&rsquo; When
Braddock reached this place it was his
design to pass through the narrows, but he
was informed by the guides who had been
out to explore that the passage was very
difficult, about two miles in length, with a
river on the left and a high mountain on
the right, and that much work must be
done to make it passable for carriages. At
the same time he was told that there were
two good fords across the Monongahela
where the water was shallow and the banks
not steep. With these views of the case he
determined to cross the fords the next
morning. The order of march was given<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
out and all the arrangements were made
for an early movement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About eight o&rsquo;clock on the morning of
the 9th the advanced division under Colonel
Gage crossed the ford and pushed
forward. After the whole army had
crossed and marched about a mile, Braddock
received a note from Colonel Gage,
giving notice that he had passed the second
ford without difficulty. A little before two
o&rsquo;clock the whole army had crossed this
ford and was arranged in the order of
march on the plain near Frazer&rsquo;s house.
Gage with the advanced party was then
ordered to march, and while the main body
was yet standing on the plain the action
began near the river. Not a single man
of the enemy had before been seen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The distance by the line of march from
Stewart&rsquo;s Crossing to Turtle Creek, or
Brush Creek, was about thirty miles. At
this point the route was changed almost to
a right angle in marching to the Monongahela.
The encampment was probably two
or three miles from the bank of the river,
for Colonel Gage marched at the break of
day and did not cross the ford till eight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
o&rsquo;clock. During the whole march from the
Great Meadows the pickets and sentinels
were frequently assailed by scouting parties
of French and Indians and several men
were killed. Mr. Gist acted as the General&rsquo;s
guide. On the 4th of July two Indians
went out to reconnoitre the country toward
Fort Duquesne; and Mr. Gist also on the
same day, in a different direction. They
were gone two days, and all came in sight
of the fort, but brought back no important
intelligence. The Indians contrived to kill
and scalp a French officer whom they found
shooting within half a mile of the fort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The army seldom marched more than
six miles a day and commonly not so much.
From Stewart&rsquo;s Crossing to Turtle Creek
there were six encampments. During one
day the army halted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall be much pleased to see Mr.
Atkinson&rsquo;s map. His knowledge of the
ground will enable him to delineate Braddock&rsquo;s
route much more accurately than it
can be done from any sources now available.</p>

<p style='text-align: right'>
I am, Sir, respectfully yours,  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>
<p>Since the foregoing letter was in type we
have received from Mr. T. C. Atkinson of
Cumberland, Maryland, lately employed on
the Pittsburgh and Connelsville Rail Road,
a very able and interesting article on the
subject of Braddock&rsquo;s route to the Monongahela,
with a very beautiful map of the
country, by Mr. Middleton, one of Mr.
Atkinson&rsquo;s assistants on the survey for the
railroad. The article of Mr. Atkinson, and
the map, furnish all the information as to
the march of General Braddock&rsquo;s army
which can now be hoped for.</p>

<p>Mr. Atkinson had for years devoted much
time to the examination of the route of the
army of Braddock eastward, and some
distance westward of Cumberland, and his
late employ along the Youghiogany and
Monongahela afforded him an opportunity
to complete his work.</p>

<p>As a striking evidence of the accuracy of
his researches, we will mention that in
tracing the route he was much surprised
and puzzled by what seemed the strange
divergence of the army from the Youghiogany
river after passing it at Stewart&rsquo;s
Crossings. Yet the traditionary evidence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
and marks on the ground seemed to establish
beyond doubt the fact that the army
had passed far into the interior of our present
county of Westmoreland, and near to
Mount Pleasant, crossing the line of the
Pittsburgh and Greensburg Turnpike road.
This seemed so far from the natural and
direct route that even the strong traditionary
and other evidence, could not entirely
remove the possibility of doubt. Mr.
Atkinson himself was entirely satisfied as
to the correctness of his own conclusions,
but of course would be gratified to receive
a confirmation, in an authentic shape, of
his own convictions.</p>

<p>Just at that crisis we received the letter
from Mr. Sparks, which precedes these
remarks, thus settling most conclusively
the verity of many of the traditions current
in the country as to the erratic course of
Braddock&rsquo;s army from Stewart&rsquo;s Crossings
to the Monongahela river.</p>

<p>We are, deeply indeed, indebted to Mr.
Atkinson, and also to his assistant, Mr.
Middleton, for their very valuable contribution
in illustration of the early history of
this country.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>The Pittsburgh and Connelsville Rail
Road project cannot be regarded as an
entirely fruitless effort; it has, at least,
produced this most valuable historical essay.</p>

<p>All additional information in relation to
those early scenes must possess interest to
every intelligent American; and we rejoice
in the opportunity of placing Mr. Atkinson&rsquo;s
valuable communication and the
accompanying map before the readers of
the <i>Olden Time</i>:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The interest with which the routes of
celebrated expeditions are regarded, and
the confusion which attends them after the
lapse of years, is well exemplified in the
case of Hannibal, whose march toward
Rome, in order to divert their army from
the siege of Capua, was totally lost in the
course of a few centuries. The constant
blunders of Livy in copying first from one
writer, and then from another who made
him take a different path, justify a recent
English historian who went to Italy to see
the ground for himself, in saying that the
Punic War was almost as hard in the writing
as the fighting.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;As the time is coming when the road
by which the unfortunate Braddock
marched to his disastrous field will be
invested with antiquarian interest akin to
that attending Hannibal&rsquo;s route, or rather
the <i>via scelerata</i>, by which the Fabian family
marched out of Rome, I have thought it
time not idly spent to attempt to pursue
its scattered traces as far as it is in my
power, among more pressing occupations.
In this sketch I do not design to pursue it
to its extent, but only to identify it in those
parts where it has been convenient for me
to visit it and in others to shadow out its
general direction. Where it is obscure I
hope to have opportunities to examine it at
a future day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of the well conducted expedition of
Colonel Bouquet and its precise path, the
publications of Mr. Hutchins, the geographer,
who was one of the engineers,
leaves us very well informed. It is presumable
that similar details would be found
of the march of 1755 if it had had a successful
termination. The three engineers
who were in the field were wounded; and
it is probable their papers fell into the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
hands of the enemy or were lost in the
flight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;General Braddock landed at Alexandria
on the 20th of February, 1755. The selection
of this port for the debarcation of the
troops, was censured at the time, though it
is probable it had the approval of Washington.
The two regiments he brought
with him were very defective in numbers,
having but about five hundred men each,
and it was expected their ranks would be
recruited in America. It is shown by the
repeated requests on this point made by
the General at Cumberland that this
expectation was vain. After numerous
delays, and a conference with the Royal
Governors, we find General Braddock <i>en
route</i> on the 24th of April when he had
reached Fredricktown in Maryland. Passing
thence through Winchester, Va., he
reached Fort Cumberland about the 9th of
May. Sir John Sinclair, Deputy Quarter
Master General, had preceded him to this
point about two weeks.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The army struck the Little Cacapehon
(though pronounced Cacapon, I have used
for the occasion the spelling of Washington
and various old documents), about six miles
above its mouth, and following the stream
encamped on the Virginia side of the
Potomac preparatory to crossing into Maryland.
The water is supposed to have been
high at the time, as the spot is known as
the Ferry-fields, from the army having
been ferried over. This was about the 4th
or 5th of May.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The army thence pursued the banks of
the river, with a slight deviation of route
at the mouth of the South Branch, to the
village of Old Town, known at that time
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>as the Shawnee Old Town, modern use
having dropped the most characteristic part
of the name. This place, distant about
eight miles from the Ferry-fields, was
known at that early day as the residence
of Col. Thomas Cresap, an English settler,
and the father of the hero of Logan&rsquo;s
speech. The road proceeded thence parallel
with the river and at the foot of the
hills, till it passes the narrows of Will&rsquo;s
Mountain, when it struck out a shorter line
coincident with the present county road,
and lying between the railroad and the
mountain, to Fort Cumberland.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From the Little Cacapehon to this
point the ground was comparatively easy,
and the road had been generally judiciously
chosen. Thenceforward the character of
the ground was altered, not so much in the
general aspect of the country as that the
march was about to abandon the valleys,
and now the real difficulties of the expedition
may be said to commence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fort had been commenced the
previous year, after the surrender at the
Great Meadows, by Col. Innes, who
had with him the two independent com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>panies
of New York and South Carolina.
It mounted ten four pounders, besides
swivels, and was favorably situated to keep
the hostile Indians in check.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;The army now consisted of 1000 regulars,
30 sailors, and 1200 provincials,
besides a train of artillery. The provincials
were from New York and Virginia;
one company from the former colony was
commanded by Captain Gates, afterwards
the hero of Saratoga. On the 8th of June,
Braddock having, through the interest and
exertions of Dr. Franklin, principally, got
150 wagons and 2000 horses from Pennsylvania,
was ready to march.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Scaroodaya</i>, successor to the Half-King
of the Senecas, and <i>Monacatootha</i>, whose
acquaintance Washington has made on the
Ohio, on his mission to Le B&#339;uf, with
about 150 Indians, Senecas, and Delawares,
accompanied him....</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first brigade under Sir Peter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
Halket, led the way on the 8th, and on the
9th the main body followed. Some idea of
the difficulties they encountered, may be
had when we perceive they spent the third
night only five miles from the first. The
place of encampment which is about one
third of a mile from the toll-gate on the
National Road, is marked by a copious
spring bearing Braddock&rsquo;s name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For reasons not easy to divine, the
route across Will&rsquo;s Mountain first adopted
for the national road was selected instead
of the more favorable one through the narrows
of Will&rsquo;s Creek, to which the road
has been changed within a few years for
the purpose of avoiding that formidable
ascent. The traces are very distinct on
the east and west slopes, the modern road
crossing it frequently. From the western
foot, the route continued up Braddock&rsquo;s
Run to the forks of the stream, where
Clary&rsquo;s tavern now stands, nine miles from
Cumberland, when it turned to the left, in
order to reach a point on the ridge favorable
to an easy descent into the valley of
George&rsquo;s Creek. It is surprising that
having reached this high ground, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
favorable spur by which the National Road
accomplishes the ascent of the Great Savage
Mountain, did not strike the attention
of the engineers, as the labor requisite to
surmount the barrier from the deep valley
of George&rsquo;s Creek, must have contributed
greatly to those bitter complaints which
Braddock made against the Colonial Governments
for their failure to assist him
more effectively in the transportation
department.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Passing then a mile to the south of
Frostburg, the road approaches the east
foot of Savage Mountain, which it crosses
about one mile south of the National Road,
and thence by very favorable ground
through the dense forests of white pine
peculiar to this region, it got to the north
of the National Road, near the gloomy
tract called the <i>Shades of Death</i>. This was
the 15th of June, when the dense gloom of
the summer woods and the favorable shelter
which those enormous pines would give an
Indian enemy, must have made a most
sensible impression on all minds, of the
insecurity of their mode of advance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This doubtless had a share in causing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
the council of war held at the Little
Meadows<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> the next day. To this place,
distant only about twenty miles from Cumberland,
Sir John Sinclair and Major Chapman
had been dispatched on the 27th of
May, to build a fort; the army having been
seven days in reaching it, it follows as the
line of march was upwards of three miles
long, the rear was just getting under way
when the advance were lighting their
evening fires.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Here it may be well enough to clear
up an obscurity which enters into many
narratives of these early events, from confusing
the names of the <i>Little Meadows</i> and
<i>Great Meadows</i>, <i>Little Crossings</i> and <i>Great
Crossings</i>, which are all distinct localities.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <i>Little Meadows</i> have been described
as at the foot of Meadow Mountain; it is well
to note that the <i>Great Meadows</i> are about
thirty-one miles further west, and near the
east foot of Laurel Hill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the <i>Little Crossings</i> is meant the
Ford of Casselman&rsquo;s River, a tributary of
the Youghiogheny; and by the <i>Great
Crossings</i>, the passage of the Youghiogheny
itself. The Little Crossing is two miles
west of the Little Meadows, and the Great
Crossing seventeen miles further west.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The conclusion of the council was to
push on with a picked force of 1200 men
and 12 pieces of cannon; and the line
of march, now more compact was resumed
on the 19th. Passing over ground to the
south of the Little Crossings, and of the
village of Grantsville, which it skirted, the
army spent the night of the 21st at the
Bear Camp, a locality I have not been able<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
to identify, but suppose it to be about midway
to the Great Crossings, which it
reached on the 23d. The route thence to
the Great Meadows or Fort Necessity was
well chosen, though over a mountainous
tract, conforming very nearly to the ground
now occupied by the National Road, and
keeping on the dividing ridge between the
waters flowing into the Youghiogheny on
the one hand and the Cheat River on the
other. Having crossed the Youghiogheny,
we are now on the classic ground of Washington&rsquo;s
early career, where the skirmish
with Jumonville, and Fort Necessity, indicate
the country laid open for them in the
previous year. About one mile west of the
Great Meadows and near the spot now
marked as Braddock&rsquo;s Grave, the road
struck off more to the north-west, in order to
reach a pass through Laurel Hill that would
enable them to strike the Youghiogheny,
at a point afterwards known as Stewart&rsquo;s
Crossing and about half a mile below the
present town of Connellsville. This part
of the route is marked by the farm known
as Mount Braddock. This second crossing
of the Youghiogheny was effected on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
30th of June. The high grounds intervening
between the river and its next tributary,
Jacob&rsquo;s Creek, though trivial in comparison
with what they had already passed, it may
be supposed, presented serious obstacles to
the troops, worn out with previous exertions.
On the 3d of July a council of war
was held at Jacob&rsquo;s Creek, to consider the
propriety of bringing forward Col. Dunbar
with the reserve, and although urged
by Sir John Sinclair with, as one may suppose,
his characteristic vehemence, the
measure was rejected on sufficient grounds.
From the crossing of Jacob&rsquo;s Creek, which
was at the point where Welchhanse&rsquo;s Mill
now stands, about 1&frac12; miles below Mount
Pleasant, the route stretched off to the
north, crossing the Mount Pleasant turnpike
near the village of the same name, and
thence by a more westerly course, passing
the Great Sewickley near Painter&rsquo;s Salt
Works, thence south and west of the Post
Office of Madison and Jacksonville, it
reached the Brush Fork of Turtle Creek.
It must strike those who examine the map
that the route, for some distance, in the rear
and ahead of Mount Pleasant, is out of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
proper direction for Fort Duquesne, and
accordingly we find on the 7th of July,
Gen. Braddock in doubt as to his proper
way of proceeding. The crossing of Brush
Creek, which he had now reached, appeared
to be attended with so much hazard that
parties were sent to reconnoitre, some of
whom advanced so far as to kill a French
officer within half a mile of Fort Duquesne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Their examinations induced a great
divergence to the left, and availing himself
of the valley of Long Run, which he turned
into, as is supposed, at Stewartsville, passing
by the place now known as Samson&rsquo;s
Mill, the army made one of the best marches
of the campaign and halted for the night at
a favorable depression between that stream
and Crooked Run and about two miles from
the Monongahela. At this spot, about four
miles from the battle ground, which is yet
well known as Braddock&rsquo;s Spring, he was
rejoined by Washington on the morning of
the 9th of July.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The approach to the river was now
down the valley of Crooked Run to its
mouth, where the point of fording is still
manifest, from a deep notch in the west<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
bank, though rendered somewhat obscure
by the improved navigation of the river.
The advance, under Col. Gage, crossed
about 8 o&rsquo;clock, and continued by the foot
of the hill bordering the broad river bottom
to the second fording, which he had effected
nearly as soon as the rear had got through
the first.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The second and last fording at the
mouth of Turtle Creek was in full view of
the enemy&rsquo;s position, and about one mile
distant. By 1 o&rsquo;clock the whole army had
gained the right bank, and was drawn up
on the bottom land, near Frazier&rsquo;s house
(spoken of by Washington as his stopping
place on his mission to Le B&#339;uf), and
about &frac34; of a mile distant from the ambuscade.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>BRADDOCK&rsquo;S ROAD IN HISTORY</h3>


<p>The narrow swath of a road cut through
the darkling Alleghenies by General
Braddock has been worth all
it cost in time and treasure. Throughout
the latter half of the eighteenth century
it was one of the main thoroughfares into
the Ohio valley, and when, at the dawning
of the nineteenth, the United States built
our first and greatest public highway, the
general alignment of Braddock&rsquo;s Road
between Cumberland and the last range of
the Alleghenies&mdash;Laurel Hill&mdash;was the
course pursued. In certain localities this
famed national boulevard, the Cumberland
Road, was built upon the very bed of Braddock&rsquo;s
road, as Braddock&rsquo;s road had been
built partly upon the early Washington&rsquo;s
Road which followed the path of Indian,
buffalo, and mound-building aborigines.
Nowhere in America can the evolution of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
road-building be studied to such advantage
as between Cumberland, Maryland and
Uniontown, Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>For some years after Braddock&rsquo;s defeat
his route to and fro between the Monongahela
and Potomac was used only by scouting
parties of whites and marauding Indians,
and many were the swift encounters that
took place upon its overgrown narrow
track. In 1758 General Forbes built a new
road westward from Carlisle, Pennsylvania
rather than follow Braddock&rsquo;s ill-starred
track, for reasons described in another
volume of the present series.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> Forbes
frightened the French forever from the
&ldquo;Forks of the Ohio&rdquo; and erected Fort Pitt
on the ruins of the old Fort Duquesne. In
1763 Colonel Bouquet led a second army
across the Alleghenies, on Forbes&rsquo;s Road,
relieved Fort Pitt and put an end to Pontiac&rsquo;s
Rebellion. By the time of Forbes&rsquo;s
expedition Braddock&rsquo;s Road was somewhat
filled with undergrowth, and was not cut
at all through the last and most important
eight miles of the course to Fort Duquesne.
Forbes had some plans of using this route,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
&ldquo;if only as a blind,&rdquo; but finally his whole
force proceeded over a new road. However,
certain portions of Braddock&rsquo;s Road
had been cleared early in the campaign
when Forbes thought it would be as well
to have &ldquo;two Strings to one Bow.&rdquo; It was
not in bad condition.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>This new northern route, through Lancaster,
Carlisle, Bedford (Reastown), and
Ligonier, Pennsylvania, became as important,
if not more so, than Braddock&rsquo;s course
from Cumberland to Braddock, Pennsylvania.
As the years passed Braddock&rsquo;s Road
seems to have regained something of its
early prestige, and throughout the Revolutionary
period it was perhaps of equal
consequence with any route toward the
Ohio, especially because of Virginia&rsquo;s interest
in and jealousy of the territory about
Pittsburg. When, shortly after the close
of the Revolution, the great flood of immigration
swept westward, the current was
divided into three streams near the Potomac;
one went southward over the Virgi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>nian
route through Cumberland Gap to
Kentucky; the other two burst over
Forbes&rsquo;s and Braddock&rsquo;s Roads. Some
pictures of the latter are vividly presented
in early records of pilgrims who chose its
rough path to gain the El Dorado beyond
the Appalachian mountain barriers.</p>

<p>William Brown, an emigrant to Kentucky
from Hanover, Virginia, over Braddock&rsquo;s
Road in 1790 has left a valuable
itinerary of his journey, together with
interesting notes, entitled <i>Observances and
Occurrences</i>. The itinerary is as follows:</p>

<p>Mr. Brown&rsquo;s notes of the journey over
the mountains are:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Set out from Hanover Friday 6th
August 1790 arrived at Redstone Old Fort
about the 25th Inst. The road is pretty
good until you get to the Widow Nelson&rsquo;s,
then it begins to be hilly and continues
generally so till you get to the Blue Ridge&mdash;pretty
well watered. Racoon ford on
Rapidan is rather bad. The little mountains
are frequently in view After you pass
Widow Nelson&rsquo;s. Pendleton&rsquo;s ford on Rappahanock
is pretty good. In going over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
Chester gap you ride about 5 miles among
the mountains before you get clear, a good
many fine springs in the Mo. between the
Blue Ridge and the Alleghany Mo. appears
to be a fine country, altho the land is pretty
much broken. At Shenandore ford there
is two branches of the river to cross and it
is bad fording. But there is a ferry a little
below the ford. There is a very cool
stream of water about 14 miles below Winchester.
This is a well watered country
but springs are rather scarce on the road,
at Winchester there are several fine
springs. The South branch of Potowmack
has a good ford, also the North branch.
Soon after you pass Gwyns Tavern in
Maryland you enter upon the Alleghany
Mo. and then you have a great deal of bad
road, many ridges of Mo.&mdash;the Winding
Ridge&mdash;Savage, Negro, etc. and Laurel
Hill which is the last, but before you get
to the Mount, there is some stony bad road
between the Widow Lewis&rsquo; and the Mo.
after you pass Clark&rsquo;s store in the Mo. you
get into a valley of very pretty oak land.
In many places while you are in the Mo.
there is very good road between the ridges.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
Just before you get to the Little Shades of
Death there is a tract of the tallest pines I
ever saw. The Shades of Death are dreary
looking valleys, growing up with tall
cypress and other trees and has a dark
gloomy appearance. Tumblestones, or the
Little Meadows is a fine plantation with
beautiful meadow ground. Crossing of
Yoh, is a pretty good ford. There is some
very bad road about here. It is said Gen
Braddock was buried about 8 miles forward
from this, near a little brook that crosses
the road. Laurel hill is the highest ridge
of the Mo. When you get to the top of it
to look forward toward Redstone there is a
beautiful prospect of the country below the
Mo. You see at one view a number of
plantations and Beason Town which is six
miles off.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>With the growth of Cumberland and the
improvement of navigation of the upper
Potomac, and especially the building of
the canal beside it, the importance of the
Braddock route across the mountains was
realized by the state of Maryland and the
legislature passed laws with reference to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
straightening and improving it as early as
1795; acts of a similar nature were also
passed in 1798 and 1802.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>A pilgrim who passed westward with his
family over Braddock&rsquo;s Road in 1796 leaves
us some interesting details concerning the
journey in a letter written from Western
Virginia after his arrival in the &ldquo;Monongahela
Country&rdquo; in the fall of that year.
Arriving at Alexandria by boat from Connecticut
the party found that it was less expensive
and safer to begin land carriage there
than to ascend the Potomac further. They
then pursued one of the routes of Braddock&rsquo;s
army to Cumberland and the Braddock
Road from that point to Laurel Hill.
The price paid for hauling their goods
from Alexandria to Morgantown (now West
Virginia) was thirty-two shillings and six-pence
per hundred-weight &ldquo;of women and
goods (freight)&rdquo;&mdash;the men &ldquo;all walked
the whole of the way.&rdquo; Crossing &ldquo;the
blue Mountain the Monongehaly &amp; the
Lorral Mountains we found the roads to be
verry bad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is difficult to say when Braddock&rsquo;s<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
Road, as a route, ceased to be used since
portions of it have never been deserted.
There are interesting references to it in the
records of Allegheny County, Maryland,
which bear the dates 1807<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> and 1813<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>. A
little later it is plain that &ldquo;Jesse Tomlinson&rsquo;s&rdquo;
is described &ldquo;on <i>National Road</i>&rdquo;
rather than on &rdquo;<i>Braddock&rsquo;s Road</i>,&rdquo; as in
1807.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> From this it would seem that by
1817 the term &ldquo;Braddock&rsquo;s Road&rdquo; was
ignored, at least at points where the Cumberland
Road had been built upon the old-time
track. Elsewhere Braddock&rsquo;s route
kept its ancient name and, perhaps, will
never exchange it for another.</p>

<p>The rough track of this first highway
westward may be followed today almost at
any point in all its course between the
Potomac and the Monongahela, and the
great caverns and gullies which mark so
plainly its tortuous course speak as no
words can of the sufferings and dangers of
those who travelled it during the dark half
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
century when it offered one of the few
passage-ways to the West. It was a clear,
sweet October day when I first came into
Great Meadows to make there my home
until those historic hills and plains became
thoroughly familiar to me. From the
Cumberland Road, as one looks southward
from Mount Washington across Great
Meadows and the site of Fort Necessity,
the hillside beyond is well-timbered on the
right and on the left; but between the
forests lies a large tract of cultivated
ground across which runs, in a straight
line, the dark outline of a heavy unhealed
wound. A hundred and fifty years of rain
and snow and frost have been unable to
remove, even from a sloping surface, this
heavy finger mark. Many years of cultivation
have not destroyed it, and for many
years yet the plow will jolt and swing
heavily when it crosses the track of Braddock&rsquo;s
Road. I was astonished to find that
at many points in Fayette and neighboring
counties the old course of the road can be
distinctly traced in fields which have for
half a century and more been under constant
cultivation. If, at certain points,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
cultivation and the elements have pounded
the old track level with the surrounding
ground, a few steps in either direction will
bring the explorer instantly to plain
evidence of its course&mdash;except where the
road-bed is, today, a travelled lane or road.
On the open hillsides the track takes often
the appearance of a terrace, where, in the
old days the road tore a great hole along
the slope, and formed a catchwater which
rendered it a veritable bog in many places.
Now and then on level ground the course
is marked by a slight rounding hollow
which remains damp when the surrounding
ground is wet, or is baked very hard when
the usual supply of water is exhausted.
In some places this strange groove may be
seen extending as far as eye can reach, as
though it were the pathway of a gigantic
serpent across the wold. At times the
track, passing the level, meets a slight
ridge which, if it runs parallel to its course,
it mounts; if the rising ground is encountered
at right angles, the road ploughs a
gulley straight through, in which the water
runs after each rain, preserving the depression
once made by the road. And as I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
journeyed to and fro in that valley visiting
the classic spots which appear in such
tender grace in the glad sunshine of a
mountain autumn, I never passed a spot of
open where this old roadway was to be seen
without a thrill; as James Lane Allen has
so beautifully said of Boone&rsquo;s old road
through Cumberland Gap to Kentucky, so
may the explorer feelingly exclaim concerning
Braddock&rsquo;s old track: &ldquo;It is impossible
to come upon this road without
pausing, or to write of it without a tribute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is particularly true of Braddock&rsquo;s
Road when you find it in the forests;
everything that savage mark tells in the
open country is re&euml;choed in mightier tones
within the shadows of the woods. There
the wide strange track is like nothing of
which you ever heard or read. It looks
nothing like a roadway. It is plainly not
the track of a tornado, though its width
and straight course in certain places would
suggest this. Yet it is never the same in
two places; here, it is a wide straight aisle
covered with rank weeds in the center of
the low, wet course; there, the forests
impinge upon it where the ground is drier;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
here, it appears like the abandoned bed of
a brook, the large stones removed from its
track lying on each side as though strewn
there by a river&rsquo;s torrent; there, it swings
quickly at right angles near the open where
the whole width is covered with velvet
grass radiant in the sunshine which can
reach it here. In the forests more than
elsewhere the deep furrow of the roadway
has remained wet, and for this reason trees
have not come up. At many points the
road ran into marshy ground and here a
large number of roundabout courses speak
of the desperate struggles the old teamsters
had on this early track a century ago. And
now and then as you pass along, scattered
blocks and remnants of stone chimneys
mark the sites of ancient taverns and
homesteads.</p>

<p>In the forests it is easy to conjure up the
scene when this old track was opened&mdash;for
it was cut through a &ldquo;wooden country,&rdquo;
to use an expression common among the
pioneers. Here you can see the long line
of sorry wagons standing in the road when
the army is encamped; and though many of
them seem unable to carry their loads one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
foot further&mdash;yet there is ever the ringing
chorus of the axes of six hundred choppers
sounding through the twilight of the hot
May evening. It is almost suffocating in
the forests when the wind does not blow,
and the army is unused to the scorching
American summer which has come early
this year. The wagon train is very long,
and though the van may have halted on
level ground, the line behind stretches
down and up the shadowy ravines. The
wagons are blocked in all conceivable positions
on the hillsides. The condition of
the horses is pitiful beyond description.
If some are near to the brook or spring,
others are far away. Some horses will
never find water tonight. To the right
and left the sentinels are lost in the surrounding
gloom.</p>

<p>And then with those singing axes for
the perpetual refrain, consider the mighty
epic poem to be woven out of the days that
have succeeded Braddock here. Though
lost in the Alleghenies, this road and all
its busy days mirror perfectly the social
advance of the western empire to which it
led. Its first mission was to bind, as with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
a strange, rough, straggling cincture the
East and the West. The young colonies
were being confined to the Atlantic Ocean
by a chain of forts the French were forging
from Quebec to New Orleans. Had they
not awakened to the task of shattering that
chain it is doubtful if the expansion of the
colonies could ever have meant what it has
to the western world. Could Virginia
have borne a son in the western wilderness,
Kentucky by name, if France had held the
Ohio Valley? Could North Carolina have
given birth to a Tennessee if France had
made good her claim to the Mississippi?
Could New England and New York and
Pennsylvania have produced the fruits the
nineteenth century saw blossom in the Old
Northwest if France had maintained her
hold within that mighty empire? The
rough track of Braddock&rsquo;s Road, almost
forgotten and almost obliterated, is one of
the best memorials of the earliest struggle
of the Colonies for the freedom which was
indispensable to their progress. There
was not an hour throughout the Revolutionary
struggle when the knowledge of
the great West that was to be theirs was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
not a powerful inspiration to the bleeding
colonies; aye, there was not a moment
when the gallant commander of those
ragged armies forgot that there was a West
into which he could retreat at the darkest
hour over Braddock&rsquo;s twelve-foot road.</p>

<p>That is the great significance of this first
track through the &ldquo;wooden country&rdquo;&mdash;an
awakened consciousness.</p>

<p>The traveller at Uniontown, Pennsylvania,
is within striking distance of Braddock&rsquo;s
Road at its most interesting points.
A six-mile climb to the summit of Laurel
Hill brings one upon the old-time route
which will be found near Washington&rsquo;s
Spring. A delightful drive along the summit
of the mountain northward brings one
near the notorious &ldquo;Dunbar&rsquo;s Camp&rdquo;
where so many relics of the campaign have
been found and of which many may be
seen in the museum of the nearby Pennsylvania
Soldiers&rsquo; Orphans&rsquo; Home. Here
Dunbar destroyed the quantities of stores
and ammunition with which he could not
advance, much less retreat. The visitor
here should find &ldquo;Jumonville&rsquo;s Grove,&rdquo;
about a quarter of a mile up the valley,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
and should not miss the view from Dunbar&rsquo;s
Knob.</p>

<p>Less than one mile eastward of Chalk
Hill, beside a brook which bears Braddock&rsquo;s
name, beneath a cluster of solemn pines,
lies the dust of the sacrificed Braddock. If
there is any question as to whether his
body was interred at this spot, there is no
question but that all the good he ever did
is buried here. Deserted by those who
should have helped him most, fed with
promises that were never kept, defeated
because he could not find the breath to cry
&ldquo;retreat&rdquo; until a French bullet drove it to
his throat&mdash;he is remembered by his
private vices which the whole world would
quickly have forgotten had he won his last
fight. He was typical of his time&mdash;not
worse.</p>

<p>In studying Braddock&rsquo;s letters, preserved
in the Public Records Office, London, it
has been of interest to note that he never
blamed an inferior&mdash;as he boasted in the
anecdote previously related. His most
bitter letter has been reproduced, and a
study of it will make each line of more
interest. His criticism of the Colonial<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
troops was sharp, but his praise of them
when they had been tried in fire was unbounded.
He does not directly criticise
St. Clair&mdash;though his successful rival for
honors on the Ohio, Forbes, accused St.
Clair in 1758 not only of ignorance but of
actual treachery. &ldquo;This Behavior in the
people&rdquo; is Braddock&rsquo;s charge, and no one
will say the accusation was unjust.</p>

<p>With something more than ordinary
good judgment Braddock singled out good
friends. What men in America, at the
time, were more influential in their spheres
than Franklin, Washington, and Morris?
These were almost the only men he, finally,
had any confidence in or respect for.
Washington knew Braddock as well as any
man, and who but Washington, in the happier
days of 1784, searched for his grave
by Braddock&rsquo;s Run in vain, desirous of
erecting a monument over it?</p>

<p>Mr. King, editor of the Pittsburg <i>Commercial-Gazette</i>,
in 1872 took an interest in
Braddock&rsquo;s Grave, planted the pines over
it and enclosed them. A slip from a willow
tree that grew beside Napoleon&rsquo;s grave at
St. Helena was planted here but did not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
grow. There is little doubt that Braddock&rsquo;s
dust lies here. He was buried in
the roadway near this brook, and at this
point, early in the last century, workmen
repairing the road discovered the remains
of an officer. The remains were reinterred
here on the high ground beside the Cumberland
Road, on the opposite bank of
Braddock&rsquo;s Run. They were undoubtedly
Braddock&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>As you look westward along the roadway
toward the grave, the significant gorge on
the right will attract your attention. It is
the old pathway of Braddock&rsquo;s Road, the
only monument or significant token in the
world of the man from whom it was named.
Buried once in it&mdash;near the cluster of
gnarled apple-trees in the center of the
open meadow beyond&mdash;he is now buried,
and finally no doubt, beside it. But its
hundreds of great gorges and vacant
swampy isles in the forests will last long
after any monument that can be raised to
his memory.</p>

<p>Braddock&rsquo;s Road broke the league the
French had made with the Alleghenies; it
showed that British grit could do as much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
in the interior of America as in India or
Africa or Egypt; it was the first important
material structure in this New West, so
soon to be filled with the sons of those who
had hewn it.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_25_25" id="Footnote_25_25"></a><a href="#FNanchor_25_25"><span class="label">[25]</span></a> In the Gordon Journal, under the date of June 10,
there are two entries. One seems to have been Gordon&rsquo;s
and reads: &ldquo;The Director of the Hospital came to see
me in Camp, and found me so ill.... I went
into the Hospital, &amp; the Army marched with the Train
&amp;c., and as I was in hopes of being able to follow them
in a few days, I sent all my baggage with the Army.&rdquo;
Without doubt this was Gordon&rsquo;s entry, as no sailor
could have had sufficient baggage to warrant such a
reference as this, while an engineer&rsquo;s &ldquo;kit&rdquo; was an important
item. Then follow two entries (June 24 and
26) evidently recorded by one who remained at Fort
Cumberland, and a second entry under the date of June
10, which is practically the first sentence of the entry
under the same date in the original manuscript, and
which has the appearance of being the genuine record
made by the sailor detained at Fort Cumberland. The
confusion of these entries in the Gordon Journal makes
it very evident that one author did not compose them.
The two entries for June 10 are typical of &ldquo;Mr Engineer
Gordon&rdquo; and an unknown sailor.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_49_49" id="Footnote_49_49"></a><a href="#FNanchor_49_49"><span class="label">[49]</span></a> &ldquo;Many misstatements are prevalent in the country
adjacent to the line of march, especially east of Cumberland,
the traditionary name of Braddock&rsquo;s route
being often applied to routes we know he did not pursue.
It is probable the ground of the application consists
in their having been used by the Quarter Master&rsquo;s
men in bringing on those Pennsylvania wagons and pack
horses procured by Dr. Franklin, with so much trouble
and at so great expense of truth. Sir John Sinclair wore
a Hussar&rsquo;s cap, and Franklin made use of the circumstance
to terrify the German settlers with the belief that
he was a Hussar who would administer to them the
tyrannical treatment they had experienced in their own
country if they did not comply with his wishes. It is
singular that a small brook and an obscure country road
in Berkley County, Virginia, bear the name of Sir John&rsquo;s
Run, and Sir John&rsquo;s Road, supposed to be taken from
the name of this officer.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_50_50" id="Footnote_50_50"></a><a href="#FNanchor_50_50"><span class="label">[50]</span></a> &ldquo;The original name of Cumberland was Cucucbetuc,
and from its favorable position on the Potomac,
was most probably the site of a Shawnee village, like
Old Town; moreover, it was marked by an Indian name,
a rare occurrence in this vicinity, if any judgment may
be drawn from the few that have been preserved.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_51_51" id="Footnote_51_51"></a><a href="#FNanchor_51_51"><span class="label">[51]</span></a> &ldquo;This interesting locality lies at the west foot of
the Meadow Mountain, which is one of the most important
of the Alleghany Ridges, in Pennsylvania especially,
where it constitutes the dividing ridge between
the eastern and western waters. A rude entrenchment,
about half a mile north of the Inn on the National Road,
kept by Mr. Huddleson, marks the site of this fort.
This is most probably the field of a skirmish spoken of
in frontier history, between a Mr. Parris, with a scouting
party from Fort Cumberland, and the Sieur Donville,
commanding some French and Indians, in which
the French officer was slain. The tradition is distinctly
preserved in the vicinity, with a misapprehension of
Washington&rsquo;s participation in it, arising probably from
the partial resemblance between the names of Donville
and Jumonville. From the positiveness of the information,
in regard to the battle ground, conflicting with
what we know of Jumonville&rsquo;s death, it seems probable
enough that this was the scene of this Indian skirmish;
and as such, it possesses a classic interest, valuable in
proportion to the scarcity of such places.</p></div>
